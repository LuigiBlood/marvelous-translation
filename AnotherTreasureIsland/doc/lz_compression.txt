Marvelous - Another Treasure Island - uses a variant of Super Mario World / A Link To The Past / Yoshi's Island compression format, also called LC_LZ2 by Lunar Compress.
Copied from https://sneslab.net/wiki/LC_LZ2

Decompression code is found at SNES address $00B904 / PC address 0x3904

The compressed data consists of "chunks", each with a header:
bits
76543210
CCCLLLLL

CCC:   Command bits
LLLLL: Length

If the header byte is $FF, the end of the compressed data has been reached, and decompression will be aborted.

Commands:
000    "Direct Copy"
       Followed by (L+1) bytes of data
001    "Byte Fill"
       Followed by one byte to be repeated (L+1) times
010    "Word Fill"
       Followed by two bytes. Output first byte, then second, then first,
       then second, etc. until (L+1) bytes has been outputted
011    "Increasing Fill"
       Followed by one byte to be repeated (L+1) times, but the byte is
       increased by 1 after each write
100    "Repeat"
       Followed by two bytes (ABCD byte order) containing address (in the
       output buffer) to copy (L+1) bytes from
101    (Unused command)
110    "16-bit length"
       This command has got a three-byte header:
	   110CCC00 LLLLLLLL LLLLLLLL
	   CCC:              Real command
	   LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL: Length
111    "10-bit length"
       This command has got a two-byte header:
       111CCCLL LLLLLLLL
       CCC:        Real command
       LLLLLLLLLL: Length

If it's a longer length, command 100, 101, 110, 111 is Repeat.
