Our leader is a fishing fanatic,

What if we left one strong guy

Our leader is a fishing fanatic,

It seems that this lever can be

[nl3]But it's too heavy for one person.
[en2]

--I wonder if I can move this...?
[en2]

The powerful water flow moved

[scl]If you'd like, you can press[C$02] on
[scl]the [C$46] panel option to take a

I didn't think so before...[np]
[nl2]But maybe Miss Gina is this way?...

It looks like we can ride in it... 
[nl2]But it only fits one person.

This thing sure moves quick!
[nl2]However, I don't think it'd move
[nl3]at all if all 3 of us got in~.
[en2]

But how can we get there...?
[en2]

Take a look, Sheriff!
[nl2]Have a piece of this!

If we pull it like this, we won't be

Dear [team] Team,
[nl2]How are your studies?[np]
[nl3]It seems Jim misjudged you after

[scl]His behavior after Miss Gina's

[scl]Despite that, it would be for the

[scl]You should either wait for the

[scl]that island.[np]
[scl]I wish you luck.

[scl]...Aren't I a nice guy?
[en1]

You're too fast!
[nl2]Show... your elders... some respect!
[en2]

[X$6A]He seems like he's guarding this
[nl2]place.
[en2]

It looks like there used to be a
[nl2]hole here...
[en2]

We sell the Baobab tree's oil in
[nl2]this village. Mr. Smith was the one
[nl3]who discovered it.[np]
[scl]If you want to know more,[np]
[scl]you should head East to his house
[scl]and ask him personally.
[en2]

My baby is sleeping, don't you
[nl2]dare wake him up...!
[en2]

Oh no, I'm sorry![np]
[nl2]Thanks to Mr. Smith, the villagers
[nl3]can make a living selling tree oil.[np]
[scl]But lately, thieves have been
[scl]coming around to steal it.[np]
[scl]By the way, I'm one of them.
[en1]

John's just inside, follow me!
[en2]

Huh!? You can see through the
[nl2]keyhole!
[en2]

Polly: Hey, small and tall![np]
[nl2]     Just what are you trying to
[nl3]     force a lil' lady to do!?[np]
[scl]     Hey~ Darlin'~
[en2]

Hehehe... Who is John?
[nl2]Well, don't look at me.
[nl3]John is over there!
[en2]

[SAwe]Wash off your shame and try
[nl2]again!
[en1]

Just kidding~! I AM John!
[nl2]Nuts, you found me.[np]
[nl3]Fine, I'll give it back.
[scl]Let's play again sometime!
[en1]

[F2]Received the {G}{a}{t}{e} {K}{e}{y} from John![np]
[nl2]...But you get a lot of keys, so
[nl3]it's not that special anymore.
[en1]

But really... I just want to try a
[nl2]grown-up game.
[en2]

There are various numbers.
[nl2]What could they be?
[en2]

...Should you try standing there?
[en2]

It looks like it might start
[nl2]moving... gross!
[en2]

Was this part of some
[nl2]experiment...?
[en2]

The ground is still wet here... [np]
[nl2]It must have broken out recently.
[en2]

It's hard to see without getting
[nl2]closer.
[en2]

What happened to your friends?[np]
[nl2]Unless all 3 of you are here, the
[nl3]ship can't depart.
[en1]

[F2]We got the phone number for the
[nl2]management office![np]
[nl3]Just as I suspected!
[en1]

The guy with the key is... John...!?
[en1]

Uhh... Which one is John!?
[en1]

It says...
[nl2] 1.Latin   3.Rock
[nl3] 2.Jazz   4.J-Pop
[en2]

Hmm~! I'm feelin' that Latin flava'!
[en2]

Hmm~! Feelin' Jazzy!
[en2]

Hmm~! I feel like rockin'!
[en2]

Hmm~!... J-Pop... Umm... M...maybe
[nl2]some J-Pop?!
[en2]

Okay, the engine stopped!
[en1]

The gate is locked and won't
[nl2]open...
[en2]

Uff. Uff.[np]

[F2]
[nl2]Now we can go deeper into the
[nl3]island!         ...It's so exciting!
[en1]

I'm a thief who steals the hearts
[nl2]of women, a heart thief!

I'm excited, but I'm still nervous...[np]
[nl2]My heart is on fire!

[en2]

[X$6A]Those little people are in trouble![np]
[nl2]...There's something familiar about
[nl3]this situation.
[en2]

That bird is all excited about
[nl2]something.[np]
[nl3]Solomon, what are you doing?!
[scl]Hurry up and help!
[en2]

H...Help me!! Hassan, I'm powerless
[nl2]to help you.[np]
[nl3]If only Princess Polly were here...
[en2]

Hey Hassan! Hey Solomon!
[nl2]Long time no see!
[nl3]It's me, Polly![np]
[scl]. . . . . . . . .[np]
[scl]Step back, I'll handle this!
[en1]

...This is probably the switch for
[nl2]the elevator.
[en2]

Ooooh! Princess!![np]
[nl2]It's been 3 months since you left
[nl3]on your journey.[np]
[scl]I was... I was so worried...
[en1]

Princess! I'm so glad to see you
[nl2]safe and sound.[np]
[nl3]Hassan was just leaving on a
[scl]journey to search for you!
[en1]

I'm sorry to make you all worry,
[nl2]but I'm just fine! I've even brought
[nl3]these 3 giants with me.[np]
[scl]I think they might be able to
[scl]defeat the {B}{l}{u}{e} {T}{h}{i}{n}{g}{s}![np]
[scl]Even though they are just kids.......[np]
[scl]My kingdom is through that cave, 
[scl]so come with us, okay?
[en1]

I won't be done in so easily!![np]
[nl2]You may have stepped on me,
[nl3]but now it's my turn!!
[en1]

[SMonkey2][X$6A]Caww! Kaaa! Kweh![np]
[nl2]TL: You stole my egg, didn't you?
[nl3]   Give it back!
[en1]

Great![SReward] I'll take that coin.[np]
[nl2]You can use these gloves during
[nl3]the match.[np]
[scl]Alright, good luck, chubby!
[en2]

Hey, only the guy with the gloves
[nl2]is allowed in the ring!
[en2]

[SStop]Alright, get over here!
[nl2]I'll send you straight to heaven!
[en1]

I'm so sorry!
[nl2]I was just trying to make a
[nl3]living...[np]
[scl]From now on, we'll work hard to
[scl]be better parents for our twins.
[scl]Please forgive us.
[en2]

Our boys John and Ken love music,
[nl2]so if they hear some sick beats
[nl3]they'll start dancing!
[en2]

[nl2]          You guys!!
[en2]

Haha... You found me out![np]
[nl2]I can't compare to the real thing,
[nl3]I guess!
[en1]

Haha... You figured out that I
[nl2]wasn't sleeping![np]
[nl3]Awe~. I want to be a grown-up so
[scl]I can stay up late.
[en2]

I don't play with dolls anymore!...
[nl2]Cuz' I'm a boy!
[en2]

Eh! What was that? I can't hear
[nl2]you over the crying baby.
[nl3]Come closer...!
[en2]

[X$6A]    Oh, she stopped crying!
[nl3][np]
[scl][X$6A]Why~ thank you!
[scl]She stopped crying when she saw
[scl]her do~ll.[np]
[scl]Now you've found all [Three] females
[scl]in the village!
[scl][np]
[scl]You kids want to know more about
[scl]the townspeople?[np]
[scl]You should ask my husband!
[scl]Oh, but you don't know who he is?[np]
[scl]You can recognize him because he
[scl]loves my cooking...[np]
[scl]He loves my cooking more than
[scl]anything else on Earth![np]
[scl]Here, take this.
[en1]

[F2]You got a spicy {B}{o}{x}{e}{d} {L}{u}{n}{c}{h}![np]
[nl2]She drew a heart out of chilli
[nl3]peppers on top of rice![np]
[scl]Oh, my... It looks like it's spicy~!
[en1]

This child won't stop crying and
[nl2]it's driving me absolutely nuts![np]
[nl3]Please do something~!
[en2]

My husband loves my cooking more
[nl2]than anything on Earth.[np]
[nl3]If you give him this lunch I made,
[scl]you'll be able to identify him right
[scl]away, I'm sure!
[en2]

I went to the basement under this
[nl2]house to get to the cave, but the
[nl3]gate was locked![np]
[scl]I'm pretty sure Mr. Smith has the
[scl]key locked up in a safe...[np]
[scl]If you want to enter the cave,
[scl]you need to find Mr. Smith...
[scl]Otherwise, just give up![np]
[scl]If you find him, come tell me right
[scl]away. I'll give you something for
[scl]your trouble.
[en2]

It's too far to tell what it is!
[en2]

[nl2]     Thanks!! I'm diggin' in!
[nl3][np]
[scl]Nom-nom-nommmmm-nooom!
[scl]Smmmmuuumm~~ff!! OH MAN!
[scl]I really love my darlin's cooking...[np]
[scl]Her cookin' is the best in the
[scl]WHOLE. WIDE. WORLD![np]
[scl]By the way, have you been able
[scl]to find the key yet?
[scl][np]
[scl][SImprtnt]What's that?... A plant that turns
[scl]into people? What on earth?...
[scl]Who's it turnin' into?![np]
[scl]If what you say is true...
[scl]that sure is a fine pickle!![np]
[scl]I used to have all kinds of
[scl]weapons for defeatin' bad guys,
[scl]but now all I have is this.[np]
[scl]Still... It's better than nothin', so
[scl]I suppose you should take it.
[en1]

[F2]Received an Empty {W}{a}{t}{e}{r} {B}{o}{t}{t}{l}{e}![np]
[nl2]This isn't a weapon at all~![np]
[nl3]It's really walking the line of
[scl]"better than nothing."
[en1]

All 3 are the same switch.
[en2]

I won't tell outsiders anything
[nl2]about this village...!
[en2]

It's too far to see what it is!
[en2]

Ohh, that looks so delicious! What?
[nl3]You'll give it to me?
[scl]That's amazin'! Thanks! Mmmm...
[en1]

W-Water!!... Water!! Quick...!
[nl2]Bring me water!!!
[en2]

GLUG, GLUG... Glug, glug...
[en1]

Okay... there are probably more of
[nl2]them, right?[np]
[nl3]You three need to listen closely to
[scl]what I'm about to tell you.
[en2]

I wonder why it's in here?
[en2]

It won't open. Do we need a key?
[en2]

[F2]The gate opened!
[nl2]Now we can go into the cave!
[en1]

P... please forgive me!
[nl2]I'm not really from this island.[np]
[nl3]I'm just a thief who heard there
[scl]was a mysterious treasure on this
[scl]island so I came to steal it.[np]
[scl]I stole the key, but in that
[scl]room... There was some kind of
[scl]plant, and when I came near...[np]
[scl]It turned into me..!
[scl]...It was so scary~!
[en1]

Thank you! You saved me![np]
[nl2]I'm in charge of this village.
[nl3]Call me Smith.[np]
[scl]I was in my basement studying the
[scl]parasite that had attached itself
[scl]to the Baobab tree when... BLAMO![np]
[scl]It quickly morphed into my likeness
[scl]and immediately attacked me!
[scl]I don't remember anything else...[np]
[scl]Oh! I have to destroy the rest of
[scl]the parasite before it escapes
[scl]and causes more trouble!!
[en1]

No one from the village would
[nl2]come into this room.[np]
[nl3]A thief must have come in here
[scl]and gotten attacked by a plant!
[en1]

I beg of you, please don't say
[nl2]that![np]
[nl2]Unless you do something, that
[nl3]crystal ball will...[np]
[scl]Please, listen to me!
[en1]

So you'll help me?! If you
[nl2]investigate all the villagers, I'm
[nl3]sure you can find the criminal![np]
[scl]First, go find a man named
[scl]Mike. He knows how many people
[scl]live in the village.[np]
[scl]Mike[SImprtnt] even gets scared at the
[scl]squeak of a mouse, so I presume
[scl]you'll find the fraidy-cat at home.
[en2]

If you want to find out how many
[nl2]people live in the village, you
[nl3]should ask Mike.[np]
[scl]He's a coward who can't bear to
[scl]hear a mouse's squeak, so he
[scl]never leaves his home.
[en2]

What?... You want to know how
[nl2]many villagers there are?[np]
[nl3]I'll only tell the big boy in the
[scl]green getup...
[en2]

By the way... I have something for
[nl2]you... Just don't tell anyone about
[nl3]my fear of mice, okay?[np]
[scl]Here, you can have this.
[en1]

[F2]You received a {V}{i}{l}{l}{a}{g}{e} {C}{o}{i}{n}![np]
[nl2]Is his secret really that big of a
[nl3]deal~?[X$6A][np]
[scl]If you lose that coin, come back
[scl]anytime! Bu~t watch out for
[scl]Jackie. He'll take your money!
[en1]

What? Another one? Fine, but keep
[nl2]quiet about that other thing,
[nl3]okay?
[en1]

I'll give you a coin whenever you
[nl2]need it, but don't let anyone know
[nl3]my secret!
[en2]

There's a small hole.
[en2]

It looks like a mouse hole!
[en2]

You need to get closer!
[en2]

Come on out, Mousey!
[nl2]Got some yummy cheeese for you~!
[en1]

Squeak squeak...[np]
[nl2]TL: Meh, I've had better...
[en2]

...What?
[nl2]I can't hear if you're over there!
[en2]

I can't do my job like this, man![np]
[nl2]Can you kids go back in and try
[nl3]to persuade Mr. Smith to let me
[scl]back inside?[np]
[scl]Will you please talk to him?[X$6A]
[scl][ ][ ][ ][ ]OK.
[scl][ ][ ][ ][ ]Nah.[X$68]
[en1]

Thanks a ton![np]
[nl2]Come see me later and I'll give
[nl3]you a reward!
[scl]            ...It's something nice![np]
[scl]Oh, I think there's a lot of {L}{u}{c}{k}
[scl]{R}{o}{c}{k}{s} in the tree west of here.[np]
[scl]Okay, I'll see you guys later!
[en1]

Don't be like that![np]
[nl2]There's just a cute little dog
[nl3]inside, so don't worry.[np]
[scl]I'm heading back to the village
[scl]now, but if you stop by later, I'll
[scl]give you a reward![np]
[scl]
[scl]            ...It's something nice!
[en1]

[F2]You got the old, {H}{o}{l}{e}{y} {C}{h}{e}{e}{s}{e}![np]
[nl2]Only Max or a mouse would
[nl3]consider this a reward...
[en1]

If you don't have anything to say,
[nl2]then get out of here!!
[en2]

He... He disappeared?!
[en2]

This dog... Seems kind of weird?!
[en2]

It's... It's moving...!!
[en2]

The inside of the collar says
[nl2]"Socks." This must have been the
[nl3]real Socks.[np]
[scl]Then what was that other dog we
[scl]saw...?
[en2]

It's no good! The line's busy...
[en2]

Hey, the ring is over there!
[en2]

Suddenly, the ship veers
[nl2]alongside!!!
[en2]

Phew, that was close...
[nl3][SImprtnt]Eeh?
[en1]

...Why have you come here?!
[en2]

Thanks to you guys I'm the
[nl2]laughing stock of the kingdom!
[nl3]I'll never forgive you!
[en2]

You have incurred the king's
[nl2]wrath. Come with me to fulfill
[nl3]your punishment.
[en1]

I'm glad the princess came back,
[nl2]but things have been getting
[nl3]stranger and stranger.[np]
[scl]Solomon seems a little blue...
[en2]

Did you already talk to Solomon?[np]
[nl2]He talks like a sissy, but he's one
[nl3]of the best warriors in the
[scl]kingdom.
[en2]

There are all sorts of mysterious
[nl2]animals deep under the ground.[np]
[nl3]Perhaps you criminals will become
[scl]a snack for them... Such a pity.
[en2]

First, our "little queenie" tomboy
[nl2]of a princess caused a ruckus by
[nl3]runnin' away from home...[np]
[scl]Next thing you know, she comes
[scl]strolling back in with three
[scl]criminals.[np]
[scl]Princess Polly is quite a handful...
[en2]

I bet you were surprised when you
[nl2]saw the king, weren't you?[np]
[nl3]This kingdom has always been very
[scl]hot. Why doesn't he take off that
[scl]heavy gown?
[en2]

Besides the {B}{l}{u}{e} {T}{h}{i}{n}{g}{s} there
[nl2]are many gigantic bugs...[np]
[nl3]But only they have formed an
[scl]army and attacked our kingdom.
[en2]

Even if the ants want to attack, 
[nl3]they can't-- thanks to the miracle
[scl]remedy, the {A}{n}{t} {B}{u}{s}{t}{e}{r}![np]
[scl]If I can complete it's production,
[scl]the Ant Menace will be abated.[np]
[scl]And so, as your punishment... You
[scl]must search the dangerous forest
[scl]for all of the ingredients.[np]
[scl]The princess says that the three
[scl]of you are capable adventurers,[np]
[scl]able to handle any challenge.
[scl]So, I'll be hoping for your success.[np]
[scl]Not only is this your punishment, I
[scl]am asking you as a personal favor
[scl]for myself. I need your help.[np]
[scl]I'm begging you. If you can help
[scl]me make the Ant Buster, I'm sure
[scl]the king will forgive you.[np]
[scl]What do you say? Will you help?[X$6A]
[scl][ ][ ][ ][ ]Okay.
[scl][ ][ ][ ][ ]No way![X$68]
[en1]

I'm begging you. If you can help
[nl2]me make the Ant Buster, I'm sure
[nl3]the king will forgive you.[np]
[scl]What do you say? Will you help?[X$6A]
[scl]    Okay.
[scl]    No way![X$68]
[en1]

I'm terribly sorry to hear that.[np]
[nl2]In accordance with the law, you
[nl3]will hearby be fed to the ants.
[scl]...I really hate to do it, but...
[en1]

Well, aren't you brave little boys![np]
[nl2]Well then, I can't let all three of
[scl]you leave together, but you can
[scl]open the gate on the right there.
[en1]

The one who stays behind must
[nl2]stand in the middle of the cell on
[nl3]the lit-up block.[np]
[scl]That will open and close the gate.
[en2]

There are 5 things you need to
[nl2]get. Read the blackboard for
[nl3]all of the details.[np]
[scl]Make sure you remember them
[scl]properly.
[en2]

This small kingdom would be
[nl2]completely overwhelmed, if the
[nl3]ants attacked tomorrow.
[en2]

Listen carefully to Hassan's fair
[nl2]judgement and repent of your sins.
[en2]

If I don't get home soon, my mom
[nl2]will find out I'm not in bed, so
[nl3]later, dudes!!
[en1]

You must not run away.[np]
[nl2]If you do, anyone left behind will
[nl3]be fed to the {B}{l}{u}{e} {T}{h}{i}{n}{g}{s}.
[en2]

You're going to the forest?[np]
[nl2]It might be better to be eaten by
[nl3]the {B}{l}{u}{e} {T}{h}{i}{n}{g}{s}...[np]
[scl]Err... I mean... Nevermind.
[en2]

Princess Polly has retired to her
[nl2]chamber. If you wish to see her,
[nl3]you'll need Solomon's permission.
[en2]

Solomon is running errands in town.
[nl2]He's probably at the artist,
[nl3]Caesar O. Enai's house.
[en2]

More and more people are coming
[nl2]back from the forest injured.
[nl3]You kids should be careful.
[en2]

If you value your life, I'd steer
[nl2]clear of here. 
[nl3]I really hate guard duty!
[en2]

A long time ago, this castle town
[nl2]was much larger. But one night,
[nl3]most of the houses just vanished.
[en2]

I've heard rumors that on the
[nl2]other side of the gigantic forest,
[nl3]there's a town of giants.[np]
[scl]Did you come from that town?

Mymy, mymy, mymy, my.[np]
[nl2]TL: I don't like anything from
[nl3]   "Mymy Home." But... I still want
[scl]   a new house.[np]
[scl]   I heard there is a human store
[scl]   with every item imaginable...
[scl]   I think that's what I want.
[en2]

Mymy, my, my.[np]
[nl2]TL: I'm terribly sorry, but I don't
[nl3]   stock human houses.
[en2]

My? My, my![np]
[nl2]TL: You'll give me that pretty
[nl3]   house? It looks great!
[en1]

[SAwe]My, my. Mymy.[np]
[nl2]TL: It's nice... but if it rains, I'll
[nl3]   get soaked. Sorry.
[en1]

My? My, my![np]
[nl2]TL: You'll give me that nice round
[nl3]   house? It looks great!
[en1]

[SAwe]My, my... My.[np]
[nl2]TL: It's comfortable enough...
[nl3]   But it sort of smells. Sorry.
[en1]

My? My, my![np]
[nl2]TL: You'll give me that fluffy
[nl3]   house? It looks great!
[en1]

[SAwe]My, my. My?[np]
[nl2]TL: It's interesting... But there isn't
[nl3]   much body to it, you know?
[en1]

My? My, my![np]
[nl2]TL: You'll give me that nice house?
[nl3]   It looks great!
[en1]

[SAwe]My! M~y, my, mymym~y.[np]
[nl2]TL: This is it! Perfect! It's just
[scl]   what I wanted! Thank you so
[scl]   very, much for this new house![np]
[scl]   I'll give you my old one...
[scl]   Sorry it's a bit used.
[en1]

[F2]You got the {F}{o}{r}{e}{s}{t} {S}{h}{e}{l}{l}![np]
[nl2]A picky shell from a picky snail.
[nl3]It's apparently been well lived in.
[en1]

Mymy, mymy, my.[np]
[nl2]TL: If you need a new home, you
[nl3]   should go with "Mymy Home."
[en2]

...Traveler, do want to "trade?"[np]
[nl2]You can have anything above the
[nl3]counter. Go ahead and choose.
[en2]

I see. Looks like you're pretty
[nl2]discerning there, eh?[np]
[nl3]That pot is actually a bullet-proof
[scl]pot worn by the great Napoleon
[scl]under his hat.[np]
[scl]You like it? You know you want it.
[scl]Pick something to trade with [Item].
[scl]Give me something good.
[en2]

Hurry, bring me the {F}{i}{r}{e}{w}{o}{o}{d}!
[nl2]What?........ I'm absolutely fine!
[nl2]You've got SOME nerve!
[en2]

You have quite an eye. The shogun
[nl2]of Yapan hid that pot in his
[nl3]secret treasure stash.[np]
[scl]Do you like it? If you want it,
[scl]choose an item you'll trade for it
[scl]from the [Item] panel.
[en2]

I can see... B... Benson...
[en2]

I see. You're a shrewd customer,
[nl2]aren't you?[np]
[nl3]That hat was used by a chef in a
[scl]three-star french restaurant for
[scl]over 30 years![np]
[scl]Does it tickle your fancy? If you
[scl]want it, choose an item you'll
[scl]trade for it from the [Item] panel.
[en2]

It... It looks real!
[nl2]How... How could that be?!
[nl3]My imagination... It must be.
[en2]

That one isn't for sale. But if you
[nl2]REALLY want it, I guess I can
[nl3]make a deal.[np]
[scl]Do you like it? If you like it, pick
[scl]an item you'll trade with [Item].
[scl]Give me something good.
[en2]

His clothes look just like the
[nl2]pirate standing...      behind you!
[en2]

Huh?
[nl2]That guy behind you looks awfully
[nl3]familiar, doesn't he...?
[en2]

I don't need anything like that.
[nl2]Don't you have anything better?
[en2]

What? It won't open.
[nl2]Maybe we need a different key...?
[en1]

[SStop]...Someone... Please help me!!
[en1]

[F2]You got {N}{a}{p}{o}{l}{e}{o}{n}{'}{s} {P}{o}{t}![np]
[nl2]If you look closely, it's all full of
[scl]holes. There's something fishy going
[scl]on here...
[en1]

[F2]You got the {S}{h}{o}{g}{u}{n}{'}{s} {P}{o]{t}![np]
[nl2]It... looks like a normal pot.
[nl3]It must be a fake.
[en1]

[F2]You got a {C}{h}{e}{f}{'}{s} {H}{a}{t}![np]
[nl2]It looks pretty new to have been
[nl3]used for 30 years... What gives?
[en1]

[F2]You got a {D}{o}{g} {H}{o}{u}{s}{e}![np]
[nl2]It looks like the only legitimate
[nl3]object in the shop.
[en1]

That's the best piece I have![np]
[nl2]It's an alien space monster shell
[nl3]from a famous sci-fi movie.[np]
[scl]Does it suit your nerd-tastic
[scl]tastes?[np]
[scl]Do you like it? If you like it, pick
[scl]an item you'll trade with [Item].
[scl]Give me something good.
[en2]

Hurry up and open it so we can
[nl2]go inside!
[en2]

[F2]Took back the {B}{u}{g} {S}{h}{e}{l}{l}![np]
[nl2]That thing wasn't in any sci-fi
[nl3]movies.
[en1]

What is it? You want to show me
[nl2]something? I can't see it from over
[nl3]there. Come a bit closer.
[en2]

Oh! Look at that! A "Frog Tail"!
[nl2]Awesome work.
[nl3]Just a moment.
[en1]

Oh! Look, it's a {F}{o}{r}{e}{s}{t} {S}{h}{e}{l}{l}!
[nl2]Awesome work.
[nl3]Just a moment.
[en1]

Oh! Looky here, a {F}{o}{r}{e}{s}{t} {C}{o}{a}{t}!
[nl2]Amazing work.
[nl3]Just a moment.
[en1]

Oh! Wowza, it's a {G}{o}{l}{d}{e}{n} {D}{r}{o}{p}!
[nl2]You've done a great job.
[nl3]Just a moment.
[en1]

Oh! Look at that, {S}{i}{l}{v}{e}{r} {T}{h}{r}{e}{a}{d}!
[nl2]Marvelous work.
[nl3]Just a moment.
[en1]

There are [X$6B] items left.
[en2]

Great! Now I have everything I
[nl2]need to make the Ant Buster.
[nl3]Let's start immediately.
[en1]

You boys are free now. Enjoy some
[nl2]sightseeing in our kingdom. I'm very
[nl3]thankful to you. Good work.
[en2]

[nl2]  This is a really lame picture.
[en2]

Come a little closer!

Don't go dropping any more honey

[nl3]I'm trying to make a living, not go

Since you found the path, here's
[nl2]a verse...
[nl3][np]
[scl]Where there's a will, there's a 
[scl]way. Where there isn't, nothing
[scl]happens.[np]
[scl]
[scl]...I plagiarized it. 
[scl]                     by Cactus
[en2]

We are storing various documents
[nl2]used to build the ant buster.[np]
[nl3]You can't just barge in here and
[scl]read everything!
[en2]

What? There's a power line down
[nl2]in the forest...? The power switch
[nl3]is inside of this room...
[scl]But if you want in, you'll need to
[scl]get the explicit permission of
[scl]soldier #[Five].[np]
[scl]Go get his permission and then
[scl]come back here.
[en1]

There are lots of confusing books
[nl2]in here. I can't figure them out.[np]
[nl3]Maybe you'll be able to find
[scl]something useful.
[en2]

There are two levers.
[nl2]Which will you pull?
[en2]

[nl2]...Okay... Maybe that did the trick?
[en1]

[nl2]      D'oh! It's pitch dark!
[en1]

There have been rumors that a
[nl2]ghost appears in the archive
[nl3]room... I hope I never see it!
[en2]

It appears that the parasite is
[nl2]sucking nutrients out from the
[nl3]Baobab tree.[np]
[scl]...It makes me feel uneasy because 
[scl]it looks as though it might come
[scl]to life at any moment.
[en2]

It's a target with someone's face
[nl2]on it!
[en2]

It won't move because it's hard,
[nl2]and regular attacks won't hurt it![np]
[nl3]Isn't there some kind of attack we
[scl]can do from up close?
[en2]

I'd like to attack here, but if you
[nl2]get close, you'll get hit!
[en2]

It's a little hot~.
[nl2]Isn't there a cooler~ song...?
[en2]

Unless you can pull it with
[nl2]something... We can't do anything
[nl3]from over here...
[en2]

This is the best for nutrition!
[en2]

Squeak, squeak.[np]
[nl2]TL: I'm so hungry... If it fit in my

Squeak, squeak![np]
[nl2]TL: We're so lonely that we'll often
[nl3]   grab onto each other's tails.[np]
[scl]   We've found it to be somewhat

[scl]   what it means to be lonely?
[en2]

Well, isn't there something we can
[nl2]use as a bridge?
[en2]

Wait until the face comes out and
[nl2]search it again!
[en2]

It's so dangerous in the mountains.
[nl2]I'd like to settle down and start a
[nl3]restaurant with my wife![np]
[scl]Her cooking is the cat's pajamas!
[en2]

How about you come marry my
[nl2]little girl when she's gets older?[np]
[nl3]...I'm only kidding, you weirdo!
[en2]

When I get older, I want to do
[nl2]costumes for movies. Movies rely
[nl3]too much on CG nowadays!
[en2]

Thanks to Mr. Smith, I became the
[nl2]real manager.
[en2]

...But without boxing, I'm just
[nl2]another handsome face...[np]
[nl3]Maybe I'll become a celebrity!
[en2]

I want to earn $10K a month...
[nl2]So I'll find a real job and work
[nl3]really hard 'til I make it!
[en2]

Listen up, I'm a rapper now,
[nl2]brother!
[en2]

Hey kids, look at this! This guy is
[nl2]even dumber than a plant~!
[en2]

Sorry... If these pictures spread
[nl2]around, I'll end up stealing more
[nl3]hearts... Aye~...
[en2]

Man, you guys really saved me![np]
[nl2]You... don't remember me, do you?
[en2]

It isn't like this is an uninhabited
[nl2]island, so I don't know why we
[nl3]have to live in a tent out here...
[en2]

Thanks for all your help. I think
[nl2]I'll write down these adventures in
[nl3]a book.
[scl]If you see it, give it a read...!
[scl]
[scl][np]
[scl]You're a good man!
[en2]

This Crystal ball belongs to you...
[nl2]So, please take it.[np]
[nl3]Today I learned that there are
[scl]yet a few mysteries in this world
[scl]that cannot be easily explained.[np]
[scl]Oh, I forgot to ask your names.
[scl][np]
[scl]Your name is [team] Team?
[scl]Gotcha! It make sense because you

Fugugo? Fuungo, fugogo![np]
[nl2]TL: ...I know. You're here for this
[nl3]thing on my back.[np]
[scl]If you think you can take it, give

[scl]I'm not a pushover like my
[scl]brothers, so get ready!
[en2]

Fugo, fugo......... Fuuungo.[np]
[nl2]TL: Of all the humans in the world,
[scl]I evaluate your skills...[np]
[scl]
[scl]...As UNRIVALED.
[scl]
[en2]

[X$6A]Looks like it may come off.

[nl2]...Oh, It's Miss Gina's voice!!
[nl3]Miss Gina! It's us! [team] Team!!
[en1]

Fugo, Fugo, fuungo.[np]
[nl2]TL: Please use it wisely.
[en2]

The King's oblivious. Sneak a peek?
[nl2]    O...okay~.
[nl3]    But, I...I couldn't![X$68]
[en1]

If we anger the King again,[np]
[nl2]there's no telling what the
[nl3]punishment would be.
[en2]

No! Nooo~! Get out~!![np]
[nl2]You cretins have barged into my
[nl3]private chambers and...
[scl][np]
[scl]...Peeped my royal bod!!
[scl][np]
[scl]Where are my guards?!
[scl]Get them out of here this very
[scl]instant! Take them away!!
[en2]

Please leave this place.
[nl2]Come to rob me of my dignity,
[nl3]have you? How embarassing...
[en2]

[F2]Bom-ba-bappa-bomba-baa![np]
[nl2]You acquired the King's {S}{t}{r}{i}{p}{e}{d}
[nl3]{U}{n}{d}{e}{r]{p}{a}{n}{t}{s}...
[en1]

He must be hot wearing such a
[nl2]thick gown.
[en2]

They have blue and green stripes
[nl2]on them. It's pretty fancy.
[en2]

Start with Green Paint and then
[nl2]mix with Red, and you'll get
[nl3]Black![np]
[scl]If you start with Red or
[scl]something, you won't get Black.
[en2]

The first color you paint
[nl2]determines the pattern.[np]
[nl3]Red makes "polka dots" appear, 
[scl]Blue makes "stripes" show up, 
[scl]and Green makes "checkers."[np]
[scl]"Why," you say? The reason...?
[scl]It's a mystery... even to me.
[en2]

Eeeek~![np]
[nl2]TL: I'm s-sorry, b-boss!
[nl3]   S-sorry, p-please don't kick me!
[en2]

Ooo~ki! Eeeek![np]
[nl2]TL: Oh, please, kick me with your
[nl3]   royal legs as much as your
[scl]   heart desires, my Queen~!
[en2]

[nl2]...Nuts.
[nl3]She can't hear us.
[en1]

The door is locked and won't open.
[en2]

I don't have anymore~!
[nl2]Because of you and the rest, 
[nl3]my wallet is dry as dust![np]
[scl]I would have been better off with
[scl]the mouse!
[en2]

[nl2]          Go home!!
[nl3][np]
[scl]The Baobab tree and the Crystal
[scl]Ball are all mine![np]
[scl]
[scl]Now leave this place, before you
[scl]get hurt!!
[en1]

Stay back when it's moving!
[en2]

Round 1 goes to the plant!
[nl2]It's got to have a weakness!
[en2]

[SStop]Sweet! The door is open now!
[en1]

It says: "Socks' house."
[en2]

It's a combination lock, so we can't
[nl2]open it.
[en2]

This doesn't look like the work of
[nl2]a human!
[en2]

On days like this it is best to
[nl2]stay indoors!
[en2]

Here's one from the heart...
[nl2]
[nl3][np]
[scl]Rain stops, spring starts, also
[scl]inside my heart.
[scl]                     by Cactus

If you want the honey, come
[nl2]closer.
[en2]

Stop dawdling and get in the ring!
[en2]

I have something to tell you, so
[nl2]get over here!
[en2]

[X$6A]The referee was... [SImprtnt]A woman! [X$6A][np]
[nl2]...I lost. So, you can keep the
[nl3]gloves...               Take 'em!
[en1]

[F2]You got {B}{o}{x}{i}{n}{g} {G}{l}{o}{v}{e}{s}![np]
[nl2]Press [BBtn] to punch your problems
[nl3]in the face! Let's do it!
[en1]

I have something for you, so get
[nl2]over here!
[en2]

Sorry for what I said earlier!
[nl2]It's just a leftover from lunch,
[nl3]but take this snack!
[en1]

If you don't have a key~,
[nl2]just give up already!
[en2]

[nl2] It goes all the way to the top.
[en2]

Heeeeyyyy~!
[nl2]Is aaanyone~ theeere~?![np]
[nl3]If you graaab~ the rooope~,
[scl]we'll puull~ you up~![np]
[scl]Do yoou~ neeed~ helllp~?
[scl][ ][ ][ ][ ]Yes, pleeease~!
[scl][ ][ ][ ][ ]Nooo~, thanks~~![X$68]
[en1]

We sprayed {A}{n}{t} {B}{u}{s}{t}{e}{r} on the
[nl2]rope and all around the hole,
[nl3]but I still don't feel very safe.
[en2]

Is the Princess safe?
[nl2]There's no way she could already
[nl3]be. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
[en2]

Even though all those soldiers
[nl2]went down, only one made it back
[nl3]alive.[np]
[scl]It seems the {A}{n}{t} {B}{u}{s}{t}{e}{r} alone
[scl]isn't enough to win this fight.
[en2]

You can't go to the "Blue Nest"
[nl2]from here. The rope slipped from
[nl3]your hands and fell out of sight.
[en2]

We finished the King's gown.[np]
[nl2]Maybe Polly's father will change
[nl3]his mind about us now.
[en2]

[nl2]It goes allll~ the way to the top.
[en1]

The King's birthday is coming up in
[nl2]only 3 day's time![np]
[nl3]I need to finish his portrait in
[scl]time for his birthday, or else!
[scl]But, woe is me...![np]
[scl]I was out on a stroll taking in the
[scl]fresh air, when suddenly...[np]
[scl]A gang of spiders from the forest
[scl]mugged me and stole my paints![np]
[scl]Oh, what will I do now~?
[en2]

What are you doing? If we see you
[nl2]do anything suspicious, the soldiers
[nl3]will arrest you again.
[en2]

The gown isn't finished yet.
[en2]

Wowzers! Those are the painting
[nl2]tools Caesar lost in the forest![np]
[nl3]Let's take them back to Caesar
[scl]right away.
[en2]

Those are the paints I lost in the
[nl2]forest... Thank you. I hope finding
[nl3]them didn't prove too troublesome.[np]
[scl]However, I'd like for you to keep
[scl]them and use them to finish this
[scl]painting.[np]
[scl]To do so, you'll need to learn my
[scl]special technique to mix two of
[scl]three paints to create patterns.[np]
[scl]The problem lies in which order to
[scl]use the paints.[np]
[scl]This painting technique can be
[scl]learned from a book of mine which
[scl]is currently in the castle archives.[np]
[scl]It should be trivial to duplicate
[scl]the look of the king's gown if you
[scl]use the patterns from the book......
[en2]

You can't paint like that.[np]
[nl2]You have to focus and use all 3
[nl3]at once.
[en2]

Unless you have all 3 paints, we
[nl2]can't finish the painting.
[en2]

[SStop]Who's gonna paint now?[np]
[nl2]Think of the king's gown and pick
[nl3]the first color.[np]
[scl]    Deon - Red
[scl]    Jack - Blue    
[scl]    Max - Green[X$6E]
[en1]

Whose color is next?
[nl2]    Deon - Red
[nl3]    Jack - Blue[X$68]
[en1]

And then whose color?
[nl2]    Deon - Red
[nl3]    Max - Green[X$68]
[en1]

Whose gonna go next?
[nl2]    Jack - Blue
[nl3]    Max - Green[X$68]
[en1]

Close, but the design is wrong.[np]
[nl2]Go clear your head and then you
[nl3]can try again later.
[en1]

It's... pitch black!! Didn't you read
[nl2]my painting book? Go take a
[nl3]breather and try again later.
[en1]

[nl2] Don't forget to paint 2 layers.
[en2]

No, no, no~! Stop it right there![np]
[nl2]Even if you paint on top of that,
[nl3]there's no way to fix it![np]
[scl]Just leave and come back later.
[en2]

You might even be better than

[scl]Don't go dropping out out of

This is the royal painter, Caesar's

I hate to admit it, but our forces

[scl]An attempt to rescue Princess

Whoops~! I forgot to tell gramps

[nl3]We're having tomatoes.
[scl]Will you tell him for me, please?
[en2]

If anything happened to Princess
[nl2]Polly, I couldn't go on living.
[nl3]Please! You must save her!
[en2]

Dear Solomon,
[nl2]I've gone with Hassan to defeat
[nl3]the {B}{l}{u}{e} {T}{h}{i}{n}{g}{s}.[np]
[scl]I forced him to keep this secret
[scl]from you. If I hadn't, you would've
[scl]insisted to come along as well.[np]
[scl]If anything happens to us, please
[scl]take care of my father.[np]
[scl]He's hopeless on his own because
[scl]he gets lonely so easily.[np]
[scl]Also, make sure those three boys
[scl]can safely leave our kingdom.[np]
[scl]I'll take care of the {B}{l}{u}{e} {T}{h}{i}{n}{g}{s}
[scl]and restore peace to our little
[scl]kingdom, you'll see.[np]
[scl]Don't worry,              -Polly
[en2]

Huh? This face.......
[nl2]It's Max! It looks just like Max!
[en2]

Want to buy some caramel?[np]
[nl2]I've run out of the free bonus,
[nl3]though.
[en2]

What? You've never heard of
[nl2]"Great Mecha"?
[nl3]You guys are so lame.[np]
[nl3]This's #3, but there's also a #1
[scl]and a #2.[np]
[scl]I used to have those too, but
[scl]someone stole them from me.[np]
[scl]But since I have #3 now, I don't
[scl]really mind as much![np]

It's a toy robot.
[nl2]It winds up in the back.

Look at what you did!
[nl2]You've ruined it! You'd better pay
[nl3]for this, you know!![np]
[scl]Just kidding!
[scl]That part falls off all the time.
[scl]It's an easy fix!
[en1]

Isn't there anyone who's on my
[nl2]level!?
[en2]

Keep this a secret from Jim.
[nl2]Come over here.
[en2]

We were doing a PK match, but we
[nl2]embarassed him in front of the
[nl3]teacher.[np]
[scl]Now he's super PO'd, so I wouldn't
[scl]be surprised if he's planning
[scl]something to get even.
[en2]

Look carefully at Jim's movement,
[nl2]and hit [BBtn] to kick it in![np]
[nl3]Make sure to equip the {S}{o}{c}{c}{e}{r}
[scl]{S}{h}{o}{e}{s} first!
[en1]

You're taking a man's challenge
[nl2]and then running away, eh?[np]
[nl3][team] Team is a bunch of
[scl]cowards. How disgraceful.
[en2]

Come on, nerds!
[nl2]You're gonna need to focus if you
[nl3]want to defeat my iron guard!
[en2]

Don't go spreading this around,
[nl2]but Jim is really "impulsive",
[nl3]so a feint can beat him.[np]
[scl]To fake him out, just lead him
[scl]away and switch leaders before
[scl]quickly kicking it in the goal.
[en2]

Use [RBtn] to change your leader
[nl2]and trick Jim with a feint.[np]
[nl3]That's the easiest way to beat

I tried to get the {F}{i}{s}{h}{i}{n}{g} {H}{o}{o}{k}
[nl2]back from Jim, but he challenged
[nl3]me to a PK shootout.[np]
[scl]When I lost, he threw my {S}{o}{c}{c}{e}{r}
[scl]{S}{h}{o}{e}{s} into the lake!
[en2]

Miss Gina told us to get some fish
[nl2]from the lake. . . . .
[nl3]Leader! What do we do!?
[en2]

We were supposed to be in charge
[nl2]of fishing, but goalkeeper Jim took
[nl3]our hook and won't give it back![np]
[scl]He's supposed to be helping us![np]
[scl]Man, if we can't get some fish,
[scl]Dorothy's gonna hate us...[np]
[scl]I'm pretty weak against forceful
[scl]women... Err, what was I saying?[np]
[scl]...*sigh*...
[en2]

Okay, if we combine the {F}{i}{s}{h}{i}{n}{g}
[nl2]{H}{o}{o}{k} with the {F}{i}{s}{h}{i}{n}{g} {R}{o}{d}...
[nl3]Alright! Now it's ready to use!
[en1]

[F2]Now it's a proper {F}{i}{s}{h}{i}{n}{g} {R}{o}{d}![np]
[nl2]Press the [BBtn] button to use it
[nl3]after it's been equiped.[np]
[scl]...So, I know you guys are on
[scl]{F}{i}{r}{e}{w}{o}{o}{d} duty, right? Heheh...[np]
[scl]Well, we've never actually fished
[scl]before in our lives, you see?[np]
[scl]Sorry to have to ask, but would
[scl]you mind catching some fish for
[scl]us?[np]
[scl]Press START and equip the {F}{i}{s}{h}{i}{n}{g}
[scl]{R}{o}{d}, then press[BBtn] to use it.[np]
[scl]That clear as mud?
[en1]

To pull in a fish, you can't just
[nl2]hold the button down. You have to
[nl3]gently apply the [CPad], okay?
[en2]

When you cast the rod, you hafta
[nl2]hold [BBtn] or it won't stay
[nl3]cast. Careful now!
[en2]

Hurry up with our fish!
[nl2]Actually, this boulder we're sitting
[nl3]on is pretty fishy...[np]...[np]

[scl]Hurry back to the castle to

Thank you for your kindness.[np]
[nl2]They came at me from behind.
[nl3]If you'll excuse me, I'll be heading

I'm in your debt. What's that? 
[nl2]And Princess Polly...?! Yes, I see!
[nl3]I'll leave it to you kids.

[nl2]...Nah. It's too hard to dig here.

[nl2] Huh? Nothing's written here.
[en2]

I can't even find the keyhole...
[nl2]How are we supposed to open
[nl3]this?
[en2]

It looks sort of like a fish, and
[nl2]sort of like a lever.[np]
[nl3]I wonder if we can give it a pull
[scl]with something...?

I wonder if this will move.

It seems like something wild was

[nl3]What could it have been?
[en2]

It's probably a lift leading to the

[en2]

H-hey! It's serious! Miss Gina was...

[nl2]making it work.
[en2]

Let's get some speed and BOOM!
[nl2]Smash it!
[en1]

What's this...?
[nl2]"Sorry! You're stuck here forever, 
[nl3]nerds! -Patchies"[np]
[scl]Sarcastic AND rude!... Humpfh!...
[en2]

It says "Sisko's House."
[nl2]But the door is locked...
[en2]

No one seems to be home.
[en2]

Let's hurry up and get the
[nl2]Crystal Ball and get out of here!
[nl3]Hurry! Hurry!
[en2]

...Kweh kweh![np]
[nl2]TL: ...These guys seem suspicious!
[en2]

Let's get close and push it.
[en2]

Fugo. Fugo. Fugo![np]
[nl2]TL: Come here!
[en2]

What are you doing?!
[nl2]The dungeon door is wide open!
[en2]

My, myy.[np]
[nl2]TL: Now that I've got a home, all
[nl3]I need... Is a wife.
[en2]

Wha?!!!!!!!! Who is this
[nl2]wrinkly old grandma?!!!!!
[en2]

Is this for real......!!!? 
[nl2]If it's a dream, then I wanna
[nl3]wake me up!!!
[en2]

You guys turned out to be a

You guys turned out to be a
[nl2]"barely marvelous" Team.
[nl3]       T h e   E n d !
[en1]

It looks like there was something
[nl2]big set here.
[en2]

You guys ended up being 
[nl2]"almost marvelous" as a Team.
[nl3]       T h e   E n d !
[en1]

You guys ended up being
[nl2]"not quite marvelous." as a Team.
[nl3]       T h e   E n d !
[en1]

Team, I think you really
[nl2]"should have tried a bit harder."
[nl3]       T h e   E n d !

You guys "really need some work"
[nl2]as a Team.

You guys were

You guys were surely
[nl2]"very disappointing" as a Team.
[nl3]       T h e   E n d !
[en1]

But what a terrible story...
[en2]

Feelin' lucky?
[nl2]Just try to get past!
[en2]

...This is just a feeling, but...[np]
[nl2]Aren't some of the soldiers from
[nl3]the castle missing?
[en2]

Hassan took the finished Ant
[nl2]Buster and left. He said he had 
[nl3]to make it stronger somehow...[np]
[scl]I think he went to Princess Polly's
[scl]room.
[en2]

All of our woes are due to those
[nl2]spineless bandits!
[en2]

He seemed to be a good person,
[nl2]but he was actually the leader of
[nl3]the bandits...
[en2]

[F2]You received a {D}{o}{g} {B}{o}{n}{e}![np]
[nl2]What a peculiar sheriff~!
[en1]

We thought there was treasure in
[nl2]here so we came in. Then the door
[nl3]closed and we were trapped![np]
[scl]So what, you still haven't found
[scl]the treasure? I don't want to get
[scl]zapped by any more lightning...[np]
[scl]So later gators!
[en1]

If you have something to say,
[nl2]come here and say it!
[en2]

The dog guarding the entrance to
[nl2]{D}{e}{a}{t}{h} {L}{a}{k}{e} is my pet.[np]
[nl3]The only time he is friendly is
[scl]when he's eating.[np]
[scl]Once he finishes his food, he falls
[scl]asleep on the spot!
[en2]

[F2]Received -Another- {D}{o}{g} {B}{o}{n}{e}!
[en1]

{D}{e}{a}{t}{h} {L}{a}{k}{e} is dangerous, so be
[nl2]careful.
[en2]

Hurry and find Indio's daughter in
[nl2]{D}{e}{a}{t}{h} {L}{a}{k}{e}.[np]
[nl3]Please save my boy!
[en2]

There's lots of interesting stuff in
[nl2]in this room. You should take a
[nl3]good look around.
[en2]

No two ways about it, this is a
[nl2]pirate~!
[en2]

My late husband was the spitting
[nl2]image of grandpa here.
[nl3]The pirate blood runs thick.
[en2]

Who is that pretty lady with that
[nl2]tough-looking kid...?
[en2]

Oh, stop it, it's me when I was
[nl2]younger, of course! I haven't
[nl3]changed that much, have I~?
[en2]

This's my only son, Bull. He left
[nl2]town to try to become a pirate
[nl3]just like his father.[np]
[scl]This was long ago... 
[scl]I wonder what he's doing now... [np]
[scl]I hope he hasn't gotten himself
[scl]killed on some far away island...
[en2]

We should take this child home
[nl2]right away... 
[nl3]I'm sure his mother is worried.
[en1]

The people in town are all wrong!
[nl2]Miss Sisko isn't a bad person at
[nl3]all! You've gotta believe me~![np]
[scl]You guys should try talking to
[scl]her, too. I'm sure you'll be able to
[scl]see that she isn't a bad person.
[en1]

The crow in the cemetery is
[nl2]guarding my father's grave.[np]
[nl3]If he sees these flowers, I'm sure
[scl]he'll remember me.
[en2]

Will you listen to what I have to
[nl2]say?
[en2]

I should be the one to do it... But
[nl2]when I think of the townspeople...
[nl3]I can't go outside.
[en2]

It's so sad... The child is confused
[nl2]and can't say see truth!
[en2]

Miss Sisko is a nice person, see?
[en2]

Y'all really saved the day.
[en2]

[X$6A]As long as this crow is here, we
[nl2]can't get near the tombstone...
[en2]

It's Christopher Benson's tombstone.
[en2]

There's a gap in the stone here...!
[nl2]I think something's inside...
[en2]

From here you can't quite tell
[nl2]what it is...?
[en2]

Caw, caw![np]
[nl2]TL: Sisko's flower!
[nl3][np]
[scl]Caw, caw![np]
[scl]TL: Indio's daughter isn't bad!
[scl]   She's a nice, pretty girl!
[en2]

If you want to check out the
[nl2]mansion to the East of here...[np]
[nl3]An old lady is living next door, so
[scl]it's easy to find.
[en2]

For bandits to steal "Treasure"
[nl2]from pirates...
[nl3]It sounds like a bad joke.
[en2]

How can this be the only water
[nl2]left in town!? If only I could turn
[nl3]back the hands of time![np]
[scl]I definitely should have dug those
[scl]wells...
[en2]

Really, I would thank you for
[nl2]taking that junk off my hands...
[en2]

Grr... Ruff! Ruff![np]
[nl2]TL: This way leads to {D}{e}{a}{t}{h}
[nl3]   {L}{a}{k}{e}.[np]
[scl]   It's a very dangerous place, so I
[scl]   won't let you pass!
[en2]

Gu-gu-gu-[np]
[nl2]TL: Zzzzzzz....
[en2]

What a spoiled dog!
[en2]

Where did you get this picture?
[nl2]Everyone in this town oughta'
[nl3]recognize these guys...
[en2]

It's the legendary pirate
[nl2]Christopher Benson, isn't it?[np]
[nl3]He tried to take back the "town's
[scl]treasure" and died doing it.[np]
[scl]He was buried in the cemetery
[scl]outside of town.
[en2]

Indio was leading the bandits!![np]
[nl2]It's his fault they attacked us,
[nl3]our water dried up, and now
[scl]nothing will go our way.
[en2]

It's called the "town's treasure."
[nl2]The legendary pirate,  Christopher
[nl3]Benson, once spoke of this...[np]
[scl]He said that it could be used to
[scl]find the Maverick's Treasure.[np]
[scl]It's said the treasure was hidden
[scl]on some other island...
[en2]

I know the guys in this picture all
[nl2]too well.
[en2]

It's Benson, yeah? He was a good
[nl2]guy, but got taken in by Indio.[np]
[nl3]He said he could use it to make a
[scl]time machine, so Benson let Indio
[scl]borrow the "town's treasure".[np]
[scl]It turned out to be a fatal
[scl]mistake, as he was hoodwinked by
[scl]the master of deception-- Indio!
[en2]

This is Indio, the leader of the
[nl2]bandits, right?[np]
[nl3]He tricked Benson with a fake
[scl]{T}{i}{m}{e} {M}{a}{c}{h}{i}{n}{e} while his bandits
[scl]made off with the "treasure".
[en2]

Now that Indio's dead, no one
[nl2]knows where the Crystal Ball is
[nl3]at.[np]
[scl]If you really want to know so
[scl]badly, make yourself a time
[scl]machine!
[en2]

I sort of recognize these people,
[nl2]but maybe not...
[en2]

Didn't this guy say "With Indio's
[nl2]help, I can time travel,"[np]
[nl3]or something crazy like that...?
[en2]

A long time ago, Indio fabricated
[nl2]outlandish stories about some
[nl3]crystal used for a time machine...[np]
[scl]They couldn't have been true
[scl]stories, right...?
[en2]

This crystal was the "town's
[nl2]treasure" to us, but to Indio it
[nl3]was a piece of a time machine.
[en2]

Wow, take a look at this picture!
[en2]

It's the legendary pirate Benson,
[nl2]isn't it?
[en2]

This guy is Indio... He's the guy
[nl2]who fooled the legendary pirate
[nl3]Benson, right?[np]
[scl]Indio filled Benson's head with lies,
[scl]but got caught trying to make his
[scl]escape.
[en2]

If you can find 4 of these Crystal
[nl2]Balls, it's rumored they'll unlock a
[nl3]marvelous treasure...[np]
[scl]Benson found this one and we kept
[scl]it as the "town's treasure."
[en2]

This is quite an old photograph...
[en2]

This man's wife lives next to the
[nl2]giant house in the East end.
[en2]

This man is the father of the girl
[nl2]who lives in {D}{e}{a}{t}{h} {L}{a}{k}{e}.
[en2]

Only Indio knew where to find the
[nl2]"town's treasure."
[nl3]But dead men tell no tales.
[en2]

What is this photograph?!
[en2]

Oh my, what a hunk.
[en2]

Ohoho, this is another fine man.
[nl2]Who could it be?
[en2]

What a pretty jewel.
[en2]

That's an old picture...
[en2]

I don't know...
[en2]

I don't know who it is... But his
[nl2]eyes look just like Miss Sisko's!
[en2]

No idea...
[en2]

This picture was very special to
[nl2]my father.
[en2]

My father told me he had made a
[nl2]time machine and had made an
[nl3]agreement for this man to use it.[np]
[scl]He was hoping this man would see
[scl]for himself that the water around
[scl]town would soon be dried up.
[en2]

It's my father, Indio. He used to
[nl2]tell me about how he could travel
[nl3]through time.
[en2]

The people of this town believe
[nl2]this is a special item.[np]
[nl3]They believe it leads to an even
[scl]greater treasure.[np]
[scl]But to us, it's really a component
[scl]of the {T}{i}{m}{e} {M}{a}{c}{h}{i}{n}{e}.
[en2]

Oh wow, what are you doing with
[nl2]that photo?
[en2]

This is my husband when he was
[nl2]younger. His name was Christopher
[nl3]Benson.[np]
[scl]He once told me, "I've found
[scl]someone who can build a time
[scl]machine."[np]
[scl]He had become quite convinced
[scl]that it was true, but he had been
[scl]deceived!
[en2]

When I met him, he didn't seem the
[nl2]type to steal things...
[en2]

My husband once discovered a
[nl2]Crystal Ball during his travels.[np]
[nl3]He told me that it was supposed
[scl]to open the path to an even
[scl]greater treasure.[np]
[scl]Later, my son left home in search
[scl]of the same Crystal Ball.
[en2]

[SImprtnt]Where did you find this photo? Did
[nl2]you show it to anyone else? Keep
[nl3]this a secret, but listen to me...[np]
[scl]Indio really did make a time
[scl]machine. The {T}{i}{m}{e} {R}{o}{o}{m} he used
[scl]is in the locked up mansion.[np]
[scl]I don't know how he did it, but
[scl]here's a message that Indio left
[scl]behind...
[en1]

Listen, the old lady over there
[nl2]should have the key to the
[nl3]mansion.
[en2]

Dang it, how could all the water
[nl2]dry up! I should have listened to
[nl3]Indio and dug more wells.
[en2]

[SImprtnt]There are 3 clocks... The first one
[nl2]is at 10:00. The next one, at 9:30,
[nl3]and the last one is at 10:30...[np]
[scl]10:00, 9:30, 10:30...
[en2]

I'll lend you the key, so come over
[nl2]here and get it!
[en2]

Now you can enter the mansion.
[en1]

[F2]Received the {M}{a}{n}{s}{i}{o}{n} {K}{e}{y}![np]
[nl2]Now you can enter the {T}{i}{m}{e}
[nl3]{R}{o}{o}{m}!
[en1]

Even now, when I look at that
[nl2]mansion, I can feel my husband's
[nl3]presence... I can't bear to enter.
[en2]

...Farewell...! And thank you.
[en1]

Arrrr' ye' sure about that?
[en2]

Arrrr' ye' really sure about that?
[en2]

Yarr... The eldest brother is
[nl2]standing to the left of the
[nl3]youngest brother.[np]
[scl]The youngest stands at the left
[scl]of the middle sibling.[np]
[scl]The middle sibling stands to the
[scl]right of the youngest brother.[np]
[scl]If ye' figure it out, point at us in
[scl]order from oldest to youngest!
[en2]

[SDenied]Garrr! A foolhardy attempt!
[nl2]Is that the best ye' got, matey?[np]
[nl3]Yarr... The eldest brother is
[scl]standing to the left of the

[scl]The youngest stands at the left

[scl]The middle sibling stands to the
[scl]right of the youngest brother.[np]
[scl]If ye' figure it out, start from
[scl]the oldest and point at us in
[scl]order! Ye' savvy, lad?
[en1]

The guard in front of Princess
[nl2]Polly's room is gone.[np]
[nl3]I wonder what happened here...?
[scl]Now anyone can come and go as
[scl]they please.
[en2]

I wonder what will be made in
[nl2]this pot? I can't wait to find out!
[en2]

Is lunch ready yet? What is
[nl2]Dorothy planning on making,
[nl3]anyway?
[en2]

The King's hobby is gardening.
[nl2]Supposedly, there is a magnificent
[nl3]garden behind the castle...[np]
[scl]But I've never actually seen it.
[en2]

It doesn't seem too heavy.
[en2]

I never thought I'd see you boys
[nl2]again. I'm so glad I was wrong.[np]
[nl3]You must have had a hard time
[scl]coming all the way here.[np]
[scl]Mr. Arnold? ...I see. So, Mr. Arnold
[scl]came to help out? That's good.
[scl]Okay, Let's get out of here.[np]
[scl]According to what the Patchies
[scl]said, the only way out is to use
[scl]the elevator behind the blue door.[np]
[scl]I found a blue box in here...
[scl]I think the key to the elevator
[scl]door is inside.[np]
[scl]Unfortunately, no matter what I
[scl]tried, I couldn't open it... Think you
[scl]boys can do something with it?
[en1]

I wonder what's for lunch~.
[en2]

Whassat?
[nl2]Lunch is another tomato dish!?
[nl3][np]
[scl]You came all the way here just to
[scl]tell me that...?[np]
[scl]Well, aren't you nice boys!
[en2]

You guys are pretty nice.
[en2]

[nl2]    Bzzt! Wrong item, Deon!
[en2]

Come on, Deon, you know better
[nl2]than that.
[en2]

Using that item makes no sense,
[nl2]Jack.
[en2]

Did you open the 3 types of
[nl2]treasure chest in the ship?[np]
[nl3]The place to use the "Small Key"
[scl]is west of the ship.
[en1]

There are 4 handles that extend
[nl2]outward from the switch.[np]
[nl3]Each time you move one position in
[scl]any direction, the numbers will
[scl]change. [np]
[scl]Turning to the Right ([CustomTurnLeft]) will cause
[scl]White numbers to appear.[np]
[scl]Turning to the Left ([CustomTurnRight]) will cause
[scl]Black numbers to appear.[np]
[scl]If the levers are turned too far
[scl]in any direction, the number will
[scl]be reset, understand?[np]
[scl]If you want another tip, I'll need
[scl][num] more {L}{u}{c}{k} {R}{o}{c}{k} from you.
[scl]Whadda ya say to that?[X$6A][np]
[scl][ ][ ][ ][ ]Yeah, I'll cough it up.
[scl][ ][ ][ ][ ]Nah, I got it.[X$68]
[en1]

I'll tell you the correct way to
[nl2]rotate the big lever...[np]
[nl3]Right [Two] times, Left [Five] times,
[scl]and Right [Four] times.[np]
[scl]...I'm pretty sure that was it.
[en1]

Did you find a fish-shaped lever
[nl2]in the cave?[np]
[nl3]Speaking of fish...
[scl]Now you get it, right~?!
[en1]

It's almost lunch time, so~---
[nl2]Let's head back~!
[en1]

Jim is in trouble across the river!
[nl2]We need the key that the fish ate.
[nl3]Look closely to see who ate it!
[en1]

Try using your "Mitt and Ball" on
[nl2]things in your way.
[nl3]It's a bopper!
[en1]

Are you stuck near the pipe?[np]
[nl2]Did you know a short enough kid
[nl3]can fit inside?
[en1]

Or... Is there a better way?
[nl2]If you think of one,
 tell me, okay?
[en2]

We have to get this child home...
[nl2]I'm sure his mother is worried!
[en2]

Thank you, my father loved this
[nl2]flower. If you show it to the
[nl3]crow, I'm sure he'll remember me.
[en1]

I was a fool to ask[team] Team
[nl2]to do anything. From now on, I'm
[nl3]calling you Sissy Team.
[en2]

Sigh... Soccer is getting boring.
[en2]

Let's do it again sometime.
[en2]

Don't let Jim know we told you,
[nl2]but... He has a crush on Miss
[nl3]Gina!
[en2]

If only you had some "Soccer
[nl2]Shoes"... With "Soccer Shoes," you
[nl3]could kick this ball like a champ...
[en2]

Why is this mansion the only locked
[nl2]building...?
[en2]

[F2]The door opened![np]
[nl2]Where could the {T}{i}{m}{e} {R}{o}{o}{m} be...?
[en2]

If you need to know anything
[nl2]about the town's history, I think I
[nl3]can still recall a few things!
[en2]

Caw caw![np]
[nl2]TL: You guys are alright!
[en2]

My dog falls straight asleep after
[nl2]eating, so don't worry.
[en1]

This is my husband's grandfather.
[en1]

This is...
[en1]

Instead of a ghost, I wish a
[nl2]sprout would come out...
[en2]

A ghost wouldn't come out in the
[nl2]daytime~.
[en2]

A... A shadow...!
[en2]

I wonder if he's really here?
[en2]

Even if he's a ghost, he's awfully
[nl2]shy...
[en2]

I've always been bad with ghosts
[nl2]and frogs....
[en2]

Indio's daughter must be behind it.
[en2]

It's a little scary, but exciting,
[nl2]too!
[en2]

Shall we give him a shake...?
[en2]

It's not that I don't trust you...
[nl2]I made a promise not to disclose
[nl3]any personal information.[np]
[scl]Especially not my name, or where I
[scl]came from.
[en2]

What's that picture? It's too far
[nl2]for me to see it well...
[en2]

Hey, it's me and Indio!
[nl2]I don't remember having this
[nl3]picture taken...[np]
[scl]...Just who are you kids?
[en1]

What in tarnation!? The "Blue
[nl2]Crystal" was stolen by
[nl3]bandits?![np]
[scl]How do you know?! If that's true,
[scl]we're in serious trouble![np]
[scl]I know where the hideout of the
[scl]"Mammoth Brothers" is, so follow
[scl]me and let's go save Indio![np]
[scl]I'll take that picture if you don't
[scl]mind.
[en2]

Let's hurry!!
[en2]

Watch this!!
[en1]

We should be able to enter
[nl2]through here. Hurry!
[en1]

Come over here.
[en2]

Maybe if we search somewhere
[nl2]else I'll remember.
[en1]

Won't you try sailing the seven
[nl2]seas as a pirate?
[en2]

What kind of joke is it for
[nl2]bandits to attack pirates~?
[en2]

Why don't you see for yourself?
[en2]

Bull! Behave yourself!!
[en2]

My mommy is pretty, isn't she?!
[en2]

When I get older, I want to be a
[nl2]teacher!
[en2]

What kind of bird's egg is this...?
[nl2]
[nl3]...Huh?!
[en1]

[F2]A baby crow hatched!
[en2]

Wow! Cool!
[en1]

I wonder how to make the flower
[nl2]open up...?
[en2]

...Maybe a good kick will do the
[nl2]trick!
[en2]

If you get too close, the thorns
[nl2]will poke you...
[en2]

Well blast me barnacles~!!
[nl2]The time warp worked!
[nl3]Indio was telling the truth![np]
[scl]So I've come to the future...?
[scl]Did the water really dry up like
[scl]Indio said it would?!
[en1]

This Crystal Ball is our ticket to
[nl2]the legendary treasure![np]
[nl3]Doesn't look like you'll be needing
[scl]this anymore, does it?
[scl]Sorry, but we'll be taking it, then!!
[en1]

See ya! We'll just let the
[nl2]townsfolk handle the rest.[np]
[nl3]Just you wait!
[en1]

Press the [BBtn] button to punch,
[nl2]hold it to guard! Okay!?
[en1]

Hehehe, later!
[en1]

The "town's treasure" is gone![np]
[nl2]You stole it, didn't you, Indio?!
[nl3]I just received an anonymous tip
[scl]about you!
[en1]

You're under arrest!
[en1]

Thanks for assisting in the arrest,
[nl2]boys! It seems that our suspicions
[nl3]are confirmed![np]
[scl]I just learned from an anonymous
[scl]source that Indio is the leader of
[scl]the mountain bandits.
[en1]

Wow! You opened it! That key will
[nl2]probably open the blue door...[np]
[nl3]Let's go there right away.
[en1]

...Isn't there another way to look
[nl2]inside?
[en2]

Without getting much closer, you
[nl2]can't see.
[en2]

[X$6A]Oh, there they are! 
[nl2]What are they talking about?
[en2]

I didn't steal the crystal ball!
[nl2]I swear! You gotta believe me![np]
[nl3]But forget the ball, we need to
[scl]dig more wells, and soon-- or the
[scl]town will run out of water![np]
[scl]I asked the boy at the lake to
[scl]start digging... Can you find him
[scl]and lend a hand?[np]
[scl]Unless those wells get dug soon,
[scl]the town will be in jeopardy!
[en2]

The town will run out of water?
[nl2]You asked the boy at the lake to
[nl3]dig wells? Enough lies!![np]
[scl]Tell me where you hid the "town's
[scl]treasure!"
[en2]

Indio asked me for a favor...[np]
[nl2]Hey, do you guys know where he
[nl3]disappeared to?
[en2]

Indio said this lake will dry up
[nl2]soon, so he asked me to dig some
[nl3]wells![np]
[scl]To dig a well, I'll need to enlist
[scl]the help of these penguins here.[np]
[scl]They have the special ability to 
[scl]sense water. Like a divining rod,
[scl]but less placebo![np]
[scl]Too bad these penguins are in the
[scl]middle of mating season! I can't
[scl]get any of them to leave the lake.[np]
[scl]Can you help me catch one?[X$6A]
[scl][ ][ ][ ][ ]Okay, sure!
[scl][ ][ ][ ][ ]Catch it yourself![X$68]
[en1]

That's the spirit!
[nl2]I'll head back and wait for you
[nl3]guys to bring me a penguin.
[en1]

I can't because... I can't swim!
[en2]

You don't have anything to dig
[nl2]with?[np]
[nl3]Okay, I'll give you my invention, a
[scl]"hole digging machine"! ......[np]
[scl]...Is what I'd like to say, but I
[scl]only have the plans drawn up so
[scl]far....[np]
[scl]Here, I'll give this to the kid who
[scl]likes building things the most.
[en2]

I'd like to give you the "hole
[nl2]digging machine" I designed, but I
[nl3]only have the plan for it.[np]
[scl]You'll have to find the parts on
[scl]your own.
[en1]

[F2]Got the {H}{o}{l}{e} {D}{i}{g}{g}{i}{n}{g} {M}{a}{c}{h}{i}{n}{e}
[nl2]{B}{l}{u}{e}{p}{r}{i}{n}{t}{s}![np]
[nl3]I think we've seen these parts
[scl]somewhere before, right...?
[en1]

Ah yes, my gut tells me there are
[nl2][Three] spots in town that're just
[nl3]right for digging a well.
[en1]

If we don't dig them fast, it'll be
[nl2]a disaster!
[en2]

[F2]You made a {H}{o}{l}{e} {D}{i}{g}{g}{i}{n}{g} {M}{a}{c}{h}{i}{n}{e}!
[nl2]Let's call it {M}{r}{.} {D}{i}{g}{g}{y}!
[en1]

But it's too heavy to lift~!
[nl2]Max, you take it!
[en2]

Let's make Max carry it!
[en2]

[nl2]     Get it together, Jack.
[en2]

[SP$012C]Moo~ moo~.
[nl2]TL: Moo moo.
[en2]

Let's get closer and try
[nl2]something...
[en2]

[SP$012C]Mrroo~ moooo.[np]
[nl2]TL: I'm really ticklish, so don't
[nl3]   come any closer!!
[en2]

You scoundrels!
[nl2]This is no way to treat a lady!
[en1]

[F2]You did it! Now the town will
[nl2]always have plenty of water![np]
[nl3]Thank you! I'll keep this penguin.
[scl]Oh, you guys, I have  something
[scl]interesting to tell you.[np]
[scl]If you want to save Indio, you'll
[scl]need to find a frog. The sheriff
[scl]hates frogs more than anything!
[en1]

Thanks to you kids, the town's
[nl2]water problems were solved.[np]
[nl3]Now we have to save Indio!
[en2]

Croak ribbit.[np]
[nl2]TL: Curse those penguins~! 
[nl3]   Hurry up and mate already!
[en2]

Rrriibit ribbit.[np]
[nl2]TL: I'm so hungry... Everything that
[nl3]   moves looks like food...
[en2]

[F2]You got a Frog!
[nl2]You earned it~.
[en2]

Let's look for the blue door
[nl2]elevator. I think it was below
[nl3]the room I was trapped in.
[en2]

Yikes! A frog!! Arrgh, Help me!!
[en1]

The guy on the left is Benson! And
[nl2]I'm next to him... Where did you
[nl3]get this picture?[np]
[scl]I don't remember posing for this...
[scl]You kids are time travelers?[np]
[scl]Please, take this photograph and
[scl]look for Benson!
[en2]

Eh? You say you know Benson?[np]
[nl2]It's not that I don't believe you,
[nl3]but do you have any proof?
[en2]

You guys must be time travelers!
[nl2]I am sure you'll be able to find
[nl3]Benson!
[en2]

Time, please protect these
[nl2]children...
[en2]

Which one do you think is good?
[nl2]Point to it!
[en2]

[SUnkwn2]I see, the one with just a
[nl2]window...[np]
[nl3]Yeah, simple is good!
[en1]

[SUnkwn2]I see, the one with a door AND a
[nl2]window... Yeah, without a door, you
[nl3]can't get inside, can you??
[en1]

[SUnkwn2]I see, the one with a door on
[nl2]top... Yeah, then if it snows, I can
[nl3]still get out!
[en1]

[SUnkwn2]Oh, the one with lots of windows...
[nl2]Good idea, then it will be really
[nl3]bright inside!
[en1]

Thanks! When I finish it, I'd like to
[nl2]show it to you... But there's still a
[nl3]long way to go...[np]
[scl]Come back when you're adults!
[en1]

[One2] isn't any good?
[nl2]Okay, then pick your
[nl3]favorite.
[en2]

Yippee! The door opened!
[en2]

Actually... M...my hip went out and
[nl2]I can't move...
[en2]

...But.
[en1]

It seems like fun, so I'll do it!
[en1]

[F2]Hooray! You got some {D}{y}{n}{a}{m}{i}{t}{e}!
[nl2]Equip it and use it with the [BBtn]
[nl3]button!
[en1]

Max, try to think before using an
[nl2]item.
[en2]

Hey, can you come a little closer?
[en2]

Stop dawdling and use the
[nl2]dynamite to find an entrance!
[en2]

Want to try it with -BOOM- one
[nl2]shot?
[en2]

Who is holding the dynamite?
[en2]

Okay, I took the dynamite back.
[nl2]When I use this, it will send up a
[nl3]lot of smoke. So, don't get lost!
[en1]

As long as our mammoth masks are
[nl2]on, you'll never get past us!
[en2]

It's too hard to push by hand...
[en2]

It's pretty heavy...
[en2]

To use teamwork, we have to
[nl2]position ourselves better.
[en2]

If we pull it like this, we'll be
[nl2]squished~!
[en2]

Want to get down?
[en2]

Without a bridge, we can't cross.
[en2]

Captain, what's the hurry?
[nl2]...But even in a hurry, your face
[nl3]looks great!
[en2]

I wonder if something would
[nl2]happen if I smacked it?
[en2]

Lukko, rakko.[np]
[nl2]TL: I scare easily, so don't startle
[nl3]   me!
[en2]

Rakko, tomakko.[np]
[nl2]TL: I scare easily, so don't startle
[nl3]   me!
[en2]

If you don't hurry, the Mammoth
[nl2]Brothers will catch you!
[en2]

You're either pretty bold, or dumb
[nl2]to try to steal anything from the
[nl3]Mammoth Brothers![np]
[scl]Hey you! The punk with the hat...!
[scl]You'll be the first to taste our
[scl]Dance of Death!!
[en1]

So you're the leader?!
[en2]

Don't think you can escape from
[nl2]us!
[en2]

........
[en2]

Pay attention to what the
[nl2]Mammoth guys say when they
[nl3]attack!
[en2]

If you don't push it quickly, the
[nl2]Mammoth guys will wake up.
[en2]

When you return to your time,
[nl2]don't forget to give me a visit,
[nl3]okay? Good!
[en2]

When you return to your time,
[nl2]don't forget to give me a visit,
[nl3]okay? Good![np]
[scl]Hurry now, I can't hold this
[scl]dramatic pose forever!
[en2]

Thank goodness he was found
[nl2]innocent...!
[en2]

It's a message Benson left for us!
[nl2]...What does it mean?
[en2]

Is something there?
[en2]

Come here and look at the
[nl2]blueprint!
[en2]

What is this picture...?
[en2]

Oh, it's Benson!
[en2]

Indio came to see Benson. He said
[nl2]the town was in trouble.
[en2]

What's the Crystal Ball called
[nl2]that leads to "Maverick's
[nl3]Treasure"?[np]
[scl]I'm pretty sure it's called the
[scl]"Blue Crystal", right?
[en2]

Hmm... What is this picture?
[en2]

Well, if it isn't Benson!
[en2]

It's a picture of when Indio met
[nl2]with Benson!
[en2]

The "Town's Treasure" was in
[nl2]Benson's hou... Hou... Achoo!!! House.
[nl3]I'm sure of it.
[en2]

What's with this picture?
[en2]

It's Benson! 
[nl2]He was a strong, fine man.
[en2]

It's Indio!
[nl2]He lives on the other side of
[nl3]penguin lake with his daughter.
[en2]

It's the "Town's Treasure."[np]
[nl2]But Indio said it was part of a
[nl3]{T}{i}{m}{e} {M}{a}{c}{h}{i}{n}{e}.
[en2]

Where'd you get this picture?!
[en2]

It's my husband!
[nl2]When did he take this
[nl3]photograph...?
[en2]

It's the man who came to see my
[nl2]husband. He said he knew how to
[nl3]travel through time...[np]
[scl]I wonder if it was true.
[en2]

It's the Crystal Ball my husband
[nl2]found.
[en2]

What is this picture?!
[en2]

It's my dad!
[en2]

I dunno!
[en2]

I haven't the slightest idea!
[en2]

What is this photo?
[en2]

It's the old man who lent us this
[nl2]house!
[en2]

It's my father! He's not in right
[nl2]now.
[en2]

It's lost to the god of time, now!
[en2]

Pii, pii.[np]
[nl2]TL: Mama! Mama!
[en2]

Flutey, flute, flute.[np]
[nl2]TL: God of time, take that man to
[nl3]   the future~.
[en2]

I wonder if it has something to do
[nl2]with that time warp...?
[en2]

Without a ship, these people don't
[nl2]really seem like pirates...
[en2]

I'm high on life!!
[en1]

...I don't really understand.[np]
[nl2]But we have to keep our cool....
[nl3]And get out of here fast!
[en2]

The Patchies were triplets...!
[en2]

"How to Pirate"
[nl2]It looks like a good read.
[en2]

I want it a little bit!
[en2]

We want to sleep in a bed, too~.
[en2]

Can you imagine trying to move one
[nl2]of these around?!
[en2]

This isn't pirate gear, right...?
[en2]

I wonder if it's still in use?
[en2]

This chair looks pretty hard.
[en2]

This is maybe a pirate rug...?[np]
[nl2]Nah... That'd just be dumb!

[en2]

Hey, our boss!
[en2]

I don't know!
[en2]

A treasure!
[en2]

What is this picture?
[en2]

Oh! Our boss!
[en2]

I don't know, but he's a looker
[nl2]alright.
[en2]

A treasure!
[en2]

Goo goo ga...
[en2]

Aaaah~! Waah! waah!
[nl2]...He's having a nightmare.
[en2]

Goo goo.
[en2]

Yay! Hooray![np]

[nl3]started cheering.
[en2]

Croak. Ribbit.[np]
[nl2]TL: Just pathetic~.
[en2]

That's Miss Sisko for ya![np]
[nl2]Her father was a fine man, and
[nl3]the same blood is in her!
[en2]

How peaceful~!
[en2]

Thanks to those two, I became
[nl2]Mayor.
[en2]

My husband once told me about
[nl2]some heroic kids that he knew.[np]
[nl3]Now that I've got a story to
[scl]match, I'm sure he'll be happy.
[en2]

Our town became prosperous
[nl2]thanks to Benson and Indio!
[en2]

Indio's daughter is a school
[nl2]teacher. She's very respectable
[nl3]just like her father.[np]
[scl]Benson's son is... Well... Nobody
[scl]knows where he went to.
[en2]

Miss Sisko reminds me of Miss
[nl2]Gina.
[en2]

Studying is all well and good.[np]
[nl2]But sometimes you need play
[nl3]outside!
[en2]

It's so nice to study under the
[nl2]great blue sky.
[en2]

This is Miss Sisko's class... but
[nl2]she's running late~.
[en2]

If you don't like studying, you
[nl2]should try Miss S's classes![np]
[nl3]They're really easy to understand!
[en2]

Hey. Hey. Isn't Miss Sisko just
[nl2]wonderful?
[en2]

Miss Sisko is a great teacher,
[nl2]isn't she?
[en2]

When you get home, say hi to your
[nl2]teacher for me.
[en2]

Isn't it a great house?!
[en2]

This is where life begins!
[en2]

[nl2]   Hey![C$56] Wait for me!
[en2]

Meow~, meow~.[np]
[nl2]TL: Darn this yarn! I'll tear you
[nl3]   thread-from-thread!
[en2]

I feel like everything is different
[nl2]than it used to be...
[en2]

Did you remember our promise?
[en2]

What's with this picture...
[en2]

I dunno...
[en2]

Couldn't tell ya...
[en2]

Never seen it before in my life...
[en2]

It doesn't look like it gets used
[nl2]much.
[en2]

It doesn't seem like we can lift
[nl2]it...
[en2]

I want it~...
[en2]

What could it be used for...?
[en2]

You shouldn't decorate your house
[nl2]with something like this.
[nl3]It'll just add to the clutter!
[en2]

Decorating your house with
[nl2]something like this'll just look bad!
[en2]

The treasure chest won't open like
[nl2]that!
[en2]

It's made of gold? That's kinda
[nl2]weird!
[en2]

Ah, hah!
[en2]

Whose grave is this...?

[en1]

Hey, [Leader], if you're the

[en2]

Thanks for your hard work!

There's lots of {F}{i}{r}{e}{w}{o}{o}{d} near the

What? A time bomb!? That's

Oh hii~! It's been far too long~.
[nl2]Things sure seem to be getting
[nl3]crazy. On my way here I............

Golly, you sure do talk a lot.
[nl2]Now's not the time for that.
[nl3]Time is of the essence. Okay?[np]
[scl]It might be scary, but wind from
[scl]below should slow your
[scl]descent...[np]
[scl]I'm sure you'll be fine.
[scl]Okay, let's do it.
[en1]

Who would have thought there was
[nl2]a balloon hidden here?
[en2]

...Gotta think fast. Someone heavy
[nl2]can go on the left... The others
[nl3]should pump from the right...
[en1]

[SStop]This is my greatest invention.[np]
[nl2]People thought human flight was
[nl3]impossible, but with this hot air
[scl]balloon, we can do it with ease.[np]
[scl]This is the treasure I leave to
[scl]anyone who is daring and
[scl]resourceful enough to find it.[np]
[scl]It's also the only way to escape
[scl]from the dungeon.[np]
[scl]I pray this device still works when
[scl]you find it.
[scl]              -Captain Maverick

Hurrah! The balloon is inflated!
[nl2]Let's hurry and get in!
[en1]

I'll let you have my "Soccer
[nl2]Shoes." You'll find them at the
[nl3]bottom of the lake!
[en2]

[SDenied]Come on, you aren't even wearing
[nl2]"Soccer Shoes!" So how are you
[nl3]going to play soccer?[np]
[scl]Come back when you wise up!!
[en2]

If you don't go underwater, you

[nl3]But it looks like the water will

We need your help![X$6A]
[nl2]      Okay.
[nl3]      Nope.[X$68]

Seems like we could have just

Sakes alive am I tired...

Let's try it like them...
[nl2]They said to position ourselves
[nl3]equally around the pot, right?
[en2]

Hm, something seems off...[np]
[nl2]Maybe our positions aren't right?

Yay! We lifted the pot!!

Half the water splashed out![np]
[nl2]Thanks, [team] Team, we were in

After you get the "fish hook"

This is a big one! It's too big for

You can put items in this wooden

[scl]Get a little closer.

Yes, you put items in this box.
[nl2]Don't worry... It's not like the item

Don't you get it? Don't give ME

Guwah! How can you be stumped
[nl2]by such a simple trap?![np]
[nl3]For shame, kids... These "Patchies"
[scl]are ordered 2, 1, 3 from the left.[np]
[scl]That's a huge hint! So... If you
[scl]still don't get it, you are just
[scl]dumb.
[en1]

The Patchies blocking the cave are
[nl2]really in the way~. What if we
[nl3]tried bopping with a ball?
[en1]

Try bumping into logs with "Dash."
[nl2]Then you can lift the log with
[nl3][TWork].
[en1]

You want to save Miss Gina, don't
[nl2]you? Then hurry up and find the
[nl3]Crystal Ball![np]
[scl]There's a path next to where Bull
[scl]collapsed.
[en1]

What should you do from here?
[nl2]...All you can do is leave the
[nl3]island on that ship, right?[np]
[scl]You have to open the unopenable
[scl]door in the ship to move it.[np]
[scl]Did you already meet a miniature
[scl]person?[np]
[scl]If not, then look along the coast
[scl]in the North and save them and
[scl]then you can open the door.
[en1]

[X$6A][SChing]You got [X$6B] Luck Rocks.
[en1]

What are you doing? What? I can't
[nl2]do anything unless you come closer.
[en2]

What's inside the chest?
[en2]

Gah! I have [Zero] {L}{u}{c}{k} {R}{o}{c}{k}{s} left.
[nl2]   ...Dang it...  ...My store... 
[nl3]I'm ruined!! Get out of here!
[en1]

...What're you going to do with all
[nl2]those {L}{u}{c}{k} {R}{o}{c}{k}{s}? Aren't you meant
[nl3]to be collecting {F}{i}{r}{e}{w}{o}{o}{d}?
[en2]

Don't you have anything better to
[nl2]do? ...Buzz off!
[en2]

I wonder if we were a little cruel
[nl2]to Jim?
[en2]

Hey, guess what, you guys?
[nl2]You have [Zero] {L}{u}{c}{k} {R}{o}{c}{k}{s}.
[nl3]Didn't notice?[np]
[scl]I'll take pity on you and give you
[scl][num] {L}{u}{c}{k} {R}{o}{c}{k} for the road.[np]
[scl]You should really quit while you're
[scl]ahead.
[en1]

[SChing]You received [num] {L}{u}{c}{k} {R}{o}{c}{k} from
[nl2]Jim. ...He might not be so bad
[nl3]after all...
[en2]

These are the {L}{u}{c}{k} {R}{o}{c}{k}{s} we
[nl2]painstakingly collected.[np]
[nl3]Don't think you'll take them all for
[scl]nothing. Give it a try if you're
[scl]feeling lucky.
[en2]

...Dang it, Jim![np]
[nl2]Those are the {L}{u}{c}{k} {R}{o}{c}{k}{s} we
[nl3]worked so hard to get...
[en2]

Is it okay to do this~? If Miss
[nl2]Gina finds out, I'll get slapped up
[nl3]and down by my mommy again~.
[en2]

...That's why I said you should
[nl2]stop. I guess we'll just have to go
[nl3]look for more {L}{u}{c}{k} {R}{o}{c}{k}{s}.
[en2]

Shall we try getting closer?
[en2]

After checking the blackboard with
[nl2][Search], you can use an item.[np]
[nl3]Use [Search] to check the crates again
[scl]please.
[en2]

Chirp, chirpy![np]
[nl2]TL: ...It's true! I don't know!
[nl3]   Believe me~!!
[en2]

Let's try a dash with [BBtn].
[en2]

How can we get it, I wonder...?
[en2]

Then show it to me ASAP.
[nl2]Prepare for departure... Hurry up!
[en2]

Why is there a hole here?
[en2]

Let's give it a smack.
[en2]

That's no good! Your timing is off.
[nl2]On the count of [Three], press the

[en1]

Come on! Press the [ABtn] button!
[nl2]Do it!

What's this picture?
[en2]

I'm certain, this is the man who
[nl2]was with Indio.
[en2]

He wasn't a bad person by any
[nl2]measure!
[en2]

Indio had it...
[en2]

Forgot? Hurry and come here.
[nl2]I'll tell you.
[en2]

Come play again.
[nl2]It seems Jim is cooking up a new
[nl3]game.
[en2]

Keep this a secret...
[nl2]It's about Jim...[np]
[nl3]He has a crush on Miss Gina.

Hehe, that tickles.

This red scarf is my trademark.
[nl2]Remember that, okay?

There's nothing in my pocket.

There's really nothing in there, OK?

Why do you keep poking me

[en2]

Please clean off the top [Two]
[nl2]windows! I can't reach them, but
[nl3]I'm sure you kids'll think of a way.
[en2]

There's a dangerous hole in the
[nl2]floor! I need you to cover it with
[nl3]a board and hammer it into place!
[en2]

I want you to move this table for
[nl2]me![np]
[nl3]Please move it from the right side
[scl]of the room to the left side. Be
[scl]careful you don't squish anybody!
[en2]

Thanks to you kids, it turned out
[nl2]alright!
[nl3]I hate to ask so much, but please
[scl]take care of the rest as well...
[en2]

Bring some other kids over!
[en2]

Once you get to this age, it's hard
[nl2]to shout.[np]
[nl3]Come a litle closer.
[en2]

Ooh~. Nice work!
[en2]

There's nothing but clocks inside, 
[nl2]but If you'd like, you can take the
[nl3]key from under the model boat.
[en2]

[SStop]Is the mansion key under here?
[en2]

It's nice to change things up in
[nl2]the room occasionally.
[en2]

It looks heavy.
[en2]

The floor still has that hole in it.
[nl2]It's impossible to move it until
[nl3]the hole's been fixed~!
[en2]

I hope granny doesn't fall in the

This would be perfect for covering

We~ lifted it![np]

Full of nutrition! It might be good

This is... probably where we are

I want to get it, but it's too far

They have something to do with
[nl2]the guys who took Miss Gina,
[nl3]right?[np]
[scl]Let's chase them down and find
[scl]out!
[en2]

You found a Key!

"Pirate Ship Lysander" is written
[nl2]on it. The name makes it sound a
[nl3]lot cooler than it looks.
[en2]

"My son Bull and Bull's mother"
[nl2]...Is written here.
[en2]

There's a painting of a pirate.
[en2]

Fight or flee?.....
[nl2]

It seems to be the tent we're in
[nl2]right now...
[en2]

Miss Gina must be in the cave to
[nl2]the North!
[en2]

There's a big lake by the cave?
[nl2]Let's use that as a landmark.
[en2]

This picture is awful!
[nl2]Miss Gina is much prettier~!!
[en2]

What if we put one of us on the

[nl3]either on top or bottom?

The pirates took the "rope" and

[nl3]I don't know where they went, but

Did you already open the treasure

Let's get a closer look.

[nl2]  Huh? Let's see what it says...  
[nl3][np]
[scl]Something about plants.
[scl]...Yada, yada, yada... Plants...
[scl][np]
[scl]Nope... You can't make heads or
[scl]tails of it. Without a specialist,
[scl]this is incomprehensible!
[en2]

Okay, I'll stay here and examine
[nl2]these notes.
[en1]

Day 1: Shortly after arrival, I
[nl2]found a mysterious ball which
[nl3]seems to be made of crystal.[np]
[scl]We brought it with us to the
[scl]center of the island, where we
[scl]found the enormous Baobab tree.[np]
[scl]The ancient tree has long
[scl]been providing vital nutrients to
[scl]plant and animal life in the area.[np]
[scl]I rested the Crystal Ball upon one
[scl]of the roots of the Baobab, and
[scl]it began to glow brightly.[np] 
[scl]Since the incident, the Baobab
[scl]seems to be producing an excess
[scl]of oil.[np]
[scl]Dead plants near the Baobab tree
[scl]have also sprang back to full
[scl]health.[np]
[scl]I worry that if discovered, the
[scl]Crystal Ball may be abused for
[scl]nefarious purposes.[np]
[scl][SImprtnt]Other strange things have started
[scl]happening on this island. I can't
[scl]quite put a finger on it.[np]
[scl]My dog "Socks" has begun acting
[scl]strangely after having gone missing
[scl]for a few hours this afternoon.[np]
[scl]Something is definitely off around
[scl]here and it has me feeling a bit...
[scl]anxious about staying.
[en2]

Have you been to the inner part
[nl2]of the island?[np]
[nl3]The oil produced here is harvested
[scl]from a Baobab tree near the back
[scl]of the island.
[en2]

He was studying the parasite's
[nl2]reaction to a certain liquid.[np]
[nl3]The strange thing is, that liquid is
[scl]common salt water![np]
[scl]No idea why it reacts to salt
[scl]water, but I made this for you.
[en1]

[F2]Got Marlowe's {S}{a}{l}{t}{w}{a}{t}{e}{r} {S}{p}{r}{a}{y}![np]
[scl]Gheesh~, that's salty!
[en1]

I guess I'll give this to the lanky
[nl2]boy who seems clever like me...[np]
[nl3]Jack!
[en2]

I'll let that lanky fellow, Jack
[nl2]have it. So come get it.
[en2]

You might be able to crack the
[nl2]riddle. I'll give this to you.
[nl3]Use it wisely!
[en1]

What kind of water is it?
[en2]

Salt water... Is it from the ocean?
[en2]

Oh~, that made a great photo!
[nl2]Splendid work, boys!
[en1]

[nl2]   The {L}{u}{c}{k} {R}{o}{c}{k}{s} are gone!!
[en1]

[nl2]    Hey, open up~!
[en2]

If they lift the lever, the door
[nl2]closes...
[en2]

Hey~, when this boat's a-rockin'
[nl2]don't come a-knockin'!
[en2]

[F2]You put {S}{a}{l}{t} {W}{a}{t}{e}{r} in the {B}{o}{t}{t}{l}{e}!
[en1]

[nl2]      Eh? What's this...?
[nl3][np]
[scl]A key!!... How do we get it...?
[scl]
[scl]Hmm... Should we use an item?
[en2]

[SStop]Okay, now we can pull the key out
[nl2]through his mouth...
[nl3]Maybe...?
[en1]

[X$79]  Aim and pull!
[nl2][ ][ ][ ][C$42][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][C$12][X$7E]
[en1]

[F2]You got the... *burp* {C}{a}{v}{e} {K}{e}{y}.[np]
[nl2]It's a little acidic.
[en1]

Is this the key to the cave?
[en2]

Take this.
[nl2]Use it wisely!
[en1]

The plant must have assumed
[nl2]human form! This calls for some
[nl3]detective work! We need to hurry.[np]
[scl]Will you help me?[X$6A]
[scl][ ][ ][ ][ ]Yes
[scl][ ][ ][ ][ ]No[X$68]
[en1]

Ooh, what great music!
[nl2]I love to drink while listening to
[nl3]this song.[np]
[scl]Whaddaya say kids, you wanna
[scl]drink up, too? It'll put some hair
[scl]on your chests!
[en1]

If you don't hurry up, it'll get
[nl2]dark out~.
[en2]

[F2]Fudge! I lost...[np]
[nl2]Fine, take this {L}{u}{c}{k} {R}{o}{c}{k}!

[nl3]Use this wisely.
[en1]

[nl2]You? I don't think so. Hah!
[en2]

It used to be a cute little plant
[nl2]like this.
[en2]

...It looks like a map.[np]
[nl2]The numbers must be... Floor
[nl3]numbers? ...There are two.
[en2]

At first I didn't wish...
[en2]

There are lots of painful-seeming
[nl2]thorns.
[en2]

Don't you have something that
[nl2]would help?
[en2]

Don't you have goosebumps?!
[en2]

For some reason...
[nl2]I want to punch it.
[en2]

Haha, I'm glad I secretly brought
[nl2]these {S}{w}{i}{m}{m}{i}{n}{g} {G}{o}{g}{g}{l}{e}{s}![np]
[nl3]I'm the only one who can enjoy
[scl]this truly amazing experience.[np]
[scl]Sorry, but I'm going to go diving
[scl]again now...
[en1]

I lost my goggles...
[nl2]...I guess I'll just watch them fish.
[en1]

[nl2]       ...My... My goggles!
[en2]

Do you know when you want to
[nl2]look at things that are far
[nl3]away, you only need to search?[np]
[scl]You only need to press [ABtn] and
[scl]then move the [CrDn] over whatever[np]
[scl]you want to check and press[ABtn].
[en2]

I'm so hungry~. Feed me~.[np]
[nl2]Come on, don't just stand there!
[en2]

I'm so hungry~...
[nl2]Feed me~...[np]
[nl3]One more time!
[en2]

[en2]

I'm so hungry, I think I'll die here.
[en2]

Humming!
[nl2]Hmmm~... Hmm~... Hum~!

I'm-- I'm so happy.
[en2]

I'm-- I'm so happy~. Heheh~...
[en2]

Those shoes are pretty sturdy.[np]
[nl2]So try kicking lots of stuff with
[nl3]them.
[en2]

Want a whiff?
[en2]

If you're boys, why don't you
[nl2]explore the island a little?
[nl3]At least run around a bit!
[en2]

...What does this star mark mean?
[nl2]Is something special here?
[en2]

...This seems to indicate where we
[nl2]are......
[en2]

Stop whining and go look for her.
[en2]

What?... You guys look awfully
[nl2]guilty! Well, whatever...[np]
[nl3]Until Miss Gina gets back, go in
[scl]the tent and listen to the

Bring the other kids here.

Wait... Don't tell me!
[nl2]You guys are seriously going after
[nl3]Miss Gina, aren't you?...[np]
[scl]
[scl]. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
[scl][np]
[scl]Okay, well, if you are, at least
[scl]take these walkie-talkies.
[en1]

When your team is too far to hear
[nl2]your whistle, equip this and use
[nl3]the [BBtn] button.

If you look closely, it might be a

[en2]

Maybe if you put fuel in here, the
[nl2]ship will move...
[en2]

It's full of soot. *cough cough*

But... Now we can't move forward.
[nl2]        What do we do?!

It looks too heavy to move, and if
[nl2]we push it inside we still can't
[nl3]get in. What should we do...?
[en2]

Yeah! Now we can keep going!
[nl2]Let's find Polly!

It seems there is still a room

[nl3]Try again?

Oh! Good eye there. You found my

[nl2]to defeat the Ant Queen, you're
[nl3]gonna need his {B}{u}{s}{t}{e}{r} {C}{a}{n}{n}{o}{n}!
[en2]

You have to wait for an opening

[nl2]to its previous size?
[nl3]The premise is hard to swallow......
[en2]

This country returned to normal
[nl2]size, right?
[nl3]I'm going to go check it out.
[en1]

...Come over here, I have something
[nl2]to tell you.
[en2]

Thanks to you guys, I saw
[nl2]something cool! Here's a secret
[nl3]prize.
[en1]

[F2]You received {L}{u}{c}{k} {R}{o}{c}{k}{s} from the
[nl2]King! You got [Five][Zero] of 'em!!
[nl3]W-wow!
[en1]

Will you go see Polly before you
[nl2]leave?[np]
[nl3]She puts out a tough fascade, but
[scl]she's a bit lonely on the inside.
[en2]

Polly doesn't really take after her
[nl2]mom... Maybe this's what it means
[nl3]to be an adult?[np]
[scl]Well... I guess this is growing up.
[en2]

The king told me I have to draw
[nl2]Polly next.
[nl3]But without a model, I can't do it.
[en2]

[F2]Perfection! You've mastered my
[nl2]{S}{p}{e}{c}{i}{a}{l} {P}{a}{i}{n}{t}{i}{n}{g} {T}{e}{c}{h}{n}{i}{q}{u}{e}.
[en2]

Customers stopped coming around
[nl2]thanks to the {B}{l}{u}{e} {T}{h}{i}{n}{g}{s}.[np]
[nl3]Thanks to the ant monsters,
[scl]business is in the pits.
[en2]

Oh, if you ever stay in an inn,
[nl2]when you restart the game, choose
[nl3]"start from inn."[np]
[scl]You can't stay in an inn while
[scl]you're playing.
[en2]

I have something to tell you, so
[nl2]come closer!
[en2]

Thank you so much!!!!
[nl2]Now the kingdom can become a
[nl3]happy place again.[np]
[scl]...Oh, leaving already?
[scl]Did you talk to Polly?
[scl]I haven't seen her lately...[np]
[scl]You're welcome to return whenever
[scl]you'd like.
[en2]

It looks like a bug carrying a
[nl2]round thing... Is that round thing
[nl3]an eagle egg?
[en2]

Two small bugs are rolling an egg.
[en2]

Shaka. Shaka. Shakaka.[np]
[nl2]TL: Just when we got rid of that
[nl3]   eagle, it's too heavy and we
[scl]   can't move~ it.
[en2]

Shaka. Shaka. Shakaka.[np]
[nl2]TL: We're eggroll-ers. If we quit
[nl3]   rolling, we'd be just plain ol'
[scl]   bugs.
[en2]

So these guys were the thieves.
[nl2]...Oh! I think we can replace the
[nl3]egg with this ball![np]
[scl]Watch their movements carefully
[scl]and press [ABtn] to take the egg.[np]
[scl]Press [BBtn] to cancel.
[en1]

[SP$0127]Now, take these 3 keys.
[en1]

Crap-. They're moving too much~.
[en1]

[F2]You got the real {E}{a}{g}{l}{e} {E}{g}{g}![np]
[nl2]Let's exchange it for the ball!
[en1]

Polly has requested your presence
[nl2]at the castle. It must be for some
[nl3]kind of "reward."
[en2]

The story of your battle with the
[nl2]{Q}{u}{e}{e}{n} is the stuff of legends.
[en2]

Everyone's waiting for you at the
[nl2]castle. Hurry up and see them.
[en2]

...Regrettably, there are still some
[nl2]who have not returned from the
[nl3]{B}{l}{u}{e} {T}{h}{i}{n}{g}{s} nest.[np]
[scl]Could they not be saved?
[en2]

At least now, the {B}{l}{u}{e} {T}{h}{i}{n}{g}{s}
[nl2]should stop attacking this country.[np]
[nl3]Now, if the monsters in the forest
[scl]would just shrink a bit...
[en2]

Even so, we can't let our guard
[nl2]down just yet. There're still giant
[nl3]monsters out there. Stay frosty.
[en2]

The {Q}{u}{e}{e}{n} of the Blue Things
[nl2]was defeated, but there are still
[nl3]giant monsters in the forest.[np]
[scl]We must yet be diligent.
[en2]

You guys might get a nice lump o'
[nl2]cash out of this.
[en2]

I should have spent more time
[nl2]honing my battle skills. Though, it's
[nl3]too late for that now.
[en2]

I just heard from Lady~ Polly...
[nl2]It's a pretty good name... I guess.
[en2]

Thank you for saving all the
[nl2]soldiers. Everyone is very grateful
[nl3]to you.
[en2]

Well, not every soldier made it
[nl2]back. But in that situation, I guess
[nl3]safety was impossible...[np]
[scl]I pray for their souls.
[en2]

The king is waiting for you.
[nl2]Hurry and go see him.
[en2]

I think I'll name my army 
[nl2]"[team]" army.
[nl3]...Yeah, that sounds good.
[en2]

I shudder to remember my
[nl2]thoughts of dying in there...
[nl3]...What a dark, terrible place.
[en2]

Hassan requested that I give you
[nl2]gifts to your heart's content.
[en2]

I bet Polly thinks much better of
[nl2]you now.
[nl3]Why don't you go see her?
[en2]

The king is also very pleased.
[nl2]Go see him.
[en2]

Come with me. The king is waiting
[nl2]for you behind the castle.
[en1]

As thanks for saving Polly, you
[nl2]may enter my secret garden.
[nl3]What do you think?[np]
[scl]I tried to combine Eastern
[scl]and Western sensabilities in the
[scl]design of this rock garden.
[en2]

...Hmm?... ...This garden?... It's my
[nl2]first time seeing it as well...[np]
[nl3]...Doesn't the ball in the middle
[scl]give you the jimmies?
[en2]

Caesar said you kids did a good
[nl2]job.[np]
[nl3]He also asked me to tell you not
[scl]to forget his "special painting
[scl]technique."
[en2]

Could it be... Is it possible!?
[nl2]We need to talk to Hassan.
[en2]

You wish to consult with me?
[nl2]Then come closer.
[en2]

...Yes~... It is indeed possible.
[nl2]...And so it's what's made us tinier
[nl3]than dwarves!?[np]
[scl]Well, that explains everything.
[scl]I see... That ball is the cause of
[scl]everything!?[np]
[scl]Wait here a moment.
[en1]

...Actually... How do I say this...
[nl2]The king has authorized you boys
[nl3]to receive the ball as a prize.[np]
[scl]It might seem like it's for our
[scl]convenience...
[scl]But please help us get rid of it.
[en1]

That ball was found in the forest
[nl2]before the kingdom shrank.[np]
[nl3]...Come to think of it...
[scl]It wasn't all that big of a
[scl]kingdom to begin with!
[en2]

We could float it into the sky and
[nl2]let the wind carry it![np]
[nl3]....Psyche! Isn't it obvious?
[scl]Something that heavy won't float.
[en2]

I may not have a college degree,
[nl2]but I don't think we'll be able to
[nl3]move such a big thing ourselves.
[scl]I wonder what that big, scary
[scl]eagle is doing right about now...?
[en2]

What if you lifted it with
[nl2]teamwork? However, the ship is
[nl3]awfully far~, isn't it...
[en2]

We've gotta do something, quick.
[en2]

...That's right!! The giant eagle
[nl2]that attacked us was looking for
[nl3]an egg![np]
[scl]If we paint this ball the same
[scl]pattern as an egg, maybe the
[scl]eagle will take it away for us![np]
[scl]So, will you give it a try?
[scl][ ][ ][ ][ ]Yeah, we got this.
[scl][ ][ ][ ][ ]What did it look like again?[X$68]
[en1]

Sounds like you'll need to go back
[nl2]to the eagle's nest and take a
[nl3]look at the eggs again. Hurry!
[en1]

Now, let's go back to the ball and
[nl2]paint it with an egg pattern!
[en2]

Let's get close and give 'er a try.
[en2]

...I wonder if this will work...
[nl2]Won't hurt to try.
[en2]

Are you ready?
[nl2]I'm not sure if this will work, but
[nl3]it's our best shot.[np]
[scl]What'll you do?[X$6A]
[scl][ ][ ][ ][ ]Let's try it.
[scl][ ][ ][ ][ ]What did it look like again?[X$68]
[en1]

[SStop]Let's start. Remember Caesar's
[nl2]special technique?
[nl3]Whose color do we paint first?[X$6A][np]
[scl]
[scl][ ][ ][ ][ ]Deon - Red
[scl][ ][ ][ ][ ]Jack - Blue    
[scl][ ][ ][ ][ ]Max - Green[X$6E]
[en1]

Whose color do we do next?
[nl2]      Deon - Red
[nl3]      Jack - Blue[X$68]
[en1]

Whose is next?
[nl2]      Deon - Red
[nl3]      Max  - Green[X$68]
[en1]

Whose color is next?
[nl2]      Jack - Blue
[nl3]      Max  - Green[X$68]
[en1]

...I don't think the eagle will be
[nl2]coming. Maybe the pattern is off?[np]
[scl]Why don't you go take one more
[scl]look at the eggs to be sure.
[en1]

Perhaps you could read Caesar's
[nl2]book "How to Paint." You'll find it
[nl3]in the castle archives.
[en2]

[SAwe]What's wrong? Just calm down,
[nl2]focus, and go look at the eggs.
[nl3]Okay?
[en1]

[SMonkey2]Caww! Caaaw! Caw![np]
[nl2]TL: I found it!!!
[nl3]   My egg!!
[en1]

[SMonkey2]Caw! Caw. Caw.[np]
[nl2]TL: My poor 'widdle egg!
[scl]   Let's go home~.
[en1]

We did it! The eagle took the ball
[nl2]away! Let's hurry to the nest and
[nl3]take it back.
[en1]

...Oh, right. No one is allowed to
[nl2]use the electric switch anymore.[np]
[nl3]Apparently it's broken.
[en2]

Hey, this game is only for someone
[nl2]who knows how to kick. Got it?
[en2]

...Huh?... You don't have any {L}{u}{c}{k}
[nl2]{R}{o}{c}{k}{s} left, chump.
[nl3]Didn't you notice?[np]
[scl]...Fine, I'll take pity and give you
[scl][num] {L}{u}{c}{k} {R}{o}{c}{k}. Maybe you should
[scl]just quit while you're ahead.
[en1]

Received [num] {L}{u}{c}{k} {R}{o}{c}{k} from Jam.
[nl2]...He might be nicer than Jim!
[en1]

Okay, you got lucky that time.
[nl2]You wanna try again?
[nl3]Don't run out on me, now.
[en1]

[X$6A]Received [X$6B] {L}{u}{c}{k} {R}{o}{c}{k}{s}.
[en1]

Listen to Winky. He's not usually
[nl2]very bright, but this time his
[nl3]instincts seem spot on.
[en2]

Ooo ooo![np]
[nl2]TL: Make Indio and daughter   
[nl3]   happy. Be careful! Bye-bye.
[en2]

Ooo-kii-kii![np]
[nl2]TL: Find man in charge on
[nl3]   island. He somewhere cramped.
[scl]   Poor guy.
[en2]

Ooo ooo aah![np]
[nl2]TL: Little king sad.
[nl3]   Tell him why so small.
[en2]

Ooo ooo!
[nl2]TL:
[en2]

Which one? Show me!
[en2]

Great, let's go find the last [Two]
[nl2]crystal balls.[np]
[nl3]After the ship leaves, we won't be
[scl]able to return to this island.[np]
[scl]So make sure you've done
[scl]everything you want to do here.
[scl]When you're ready, start her up!
[en2]

Great, let's go find the last
[nl2]Crystal Ball.[np]
[nl3]Do you have enough {L}{u}{c}{k} {R}{o}{c}{k}{s}?
[scl]You can take it from here!
[en2]

Okay, now everything is in order.
[nl2]Let's head back to the island.
[nl3]. . . . . . . . . . . ?!
[en2]

Hurry and show Pluck!
[en2]

[nl2]   We've arrived at an island!
[en1]

Ooo! Kii-kii![np]
[nl2]TL: Move ship to save teacher!
[nl3]   Hurry! Hurry!
[en1]

[SP$033A]Chirpoo![np]
[nl2]TL: Come on, Winky, you have to
[nl3]   explain from the beginning!
[en1]

The door in the cave can't be
[nl2]opened using only one Crystal Ball.
[en1]

In order to open the door, you
[nl2]need[Space4][Three] more Crystal Balls.[np]
[nl3]Don't blame me, it's the first
[scl]puzzle left by Captain Maverick.[np]
[scl]We can use this ship to track
[scl]down the other[Three] balls.[np]
[scl]It's the only way to save your
[scl]teacher. Otherwise, you'll end up
[scl]like those pirates.[np]
[scl]So, how about it? You got it?
[scl][ ][ ][ ][ ]Yes.
[scl][ ][ ][ ][ ]No.[X$68]
[en1]

You don't understand anything~?
[nl2]Seriously, it's like there are FOUR
[nl3]Winkys before me![np]
[scl]What don't you get?
[en1]

Let me see the Crystal Ball.
[nl2]It should show the position of the
[nl3]next Crystal Ball... Like a compass.
[en1]

Now, you need to put [X$6B] {L}{u}{c}{k}
[nl2]{R}{o}{c}{k}{s} in the furnace below deck
[nl3]and then pull the giant lever.
[en2]

It looks like you've stoked the
[nl2]furnace below deck.
[nl3]Now, you need to pull the lever.
[en2]

After you put in the {L}{u}{c}{k} {R}{o}{c}{k}{s},
[nl2]pull the lever.
[en2]

Fill hot thing down stair.
[nl2]Hurry! Hurry!
[en2]

After you get the ship moving, you
[nl2]have to hold the wheel steady.[np]
[nl3]Otherwise, we'll never reach the
[scl]next island.
[en2]

We all in this together!
[nl2]Friends! Friends!
[en2]

Hold her steady!
[en2]

Why don't you go relax outside
[nl2]until we reach the next island?
[en2]

Know what next?
[nl2]Oooooooo-Ahhhh!
[nl3]What next? What next??
[en2]

The ship is listing out of control...[np]
[nl3]When the compass is pointing
[scl]straight ahead, that's when you'll
[scl]need to lock in the course.[np]
[scl]Take hold of the helm!
[en2]

[X$79]       Press to lock on.
[nl2][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][C$12][X$7E]
[en1]

The island with the next Crystal
[nl2]Ball must be this way.
[en2]

It's locked on.
[en2]

It looks like we can just barely
[nl2]reach it.
[en2]

Pull the lever!
[en2]

All do together! Hurry! Hurry!
[en2]

[SMonkey2]Kweh! Caaaaaw![np]
[nl2]TL: I'll never leave my eggs again![np]
[nl3]
[scl]...Now's our chance!
[en2]

...This is a real egg...
[en1]

[SMonkey2]Kweh?! Caaw?![np]
[nl2]TL: What's going on?
[nl3]   ...There are 4 eggs?
[en1]

[SMonkey2]Caaw? Kweh!![np]
[nl2]TL: What's this?
[nl3]   This one isn't mine!!
[en1]

[SMonkey2]Caaw. Kweh![np]
[nl2]TL: Wow, that almost fooled me.
[scl]   I'm taking my egg back!
[en1]

[SMonkey2]Caaw. Kweh~.[np]
[nl2]TL: Stay away from my eggs.
[en2]

Let's get back to the ship right
[nl2]away.
[en2]

What are you doing?
[nl2]Hurry up and get over here.
[en2]

Did you put the {L}{u}{c}{k} {R}{o}{c}{k}{s} in the
[nl2]furnace? If you need more, I'll
[nl3]give you mine.[np]
[scl]Need an assist?
[scl][ ][ ][ ][ ]Yes, please.
[scl][ ][ ][ ][ ]I don't need you![X$68]
[en1]

Well, fine then!
[nl2]Go below deck and prepare for
[nl3]departure!           ...Slowpoke.
[en2]

You guys have [X$6C] {L}{u}{c}{k} {R}{o}{c}{k}{s},
[nl2]so you need [X$6B] more.
[nl3]Here you are.
[en1]

...We got [X$6B] {L}{u}{c}{k} {R}{o}{c}{k}{s} from Polly.
[nl2]Well, that was unexpectedly nice.
[en1]

What are you on about?
[nl2]You guys are lazy piggies!
[nl3]Hurry up and get down below!
[en1]

Did you already fill the furnace?
[nl2]Hurry up if you haven't...[np]
[nl3]You don't have any time to waste,
[scl]do you?!
[en2]

[SP$0017] ...Just kidding. I'm not going.[np]
[nl2]I really want to go with you
[nl3]all... But I can't leave my father
[scl]alone like this.[np]
[scl]My journey ends here.
[en1]

Oookii, oookii-kii![np]
[nl2]TL: Girl... scare me.
[en2]

Chirpy chirpoo.[np]
[nl2]TL: I wonder if she still wants to
[nl3]   travel with us-?
[en2]

...There are two polka dot eggs.
[nl2]It looks like another egg would fit
[nl3]in the nest.
[en2]

I wonder if whoever sailed this
[nl2]ship ran it alone?
[en2]

It looks like it would take a lot
[nl2]of power to move this...
[en2]

The ship's captain sat here, I
[nl2]guess.
[en2]

Maybe those guys who kidnapped
[nl2]Miss Gina would know?
[en2]

Alright, let's flip this one.
[en1]

Chirp chirpy![np]
[nl2]TL: Your timing was off!
[nl3]   Lock it in when it changes
[scl]   color, ya' deadweight~!
[en1]

Chirpy chirpy.[np]
[nl2]TL: Good job-! Now we can go to
[nl3]   the next island!
[en1]

The island I just came from was
[nl2]crazy~! They were having some
[nl3]horrible drought.[np]
[scl]The people and fields were just
[scl]dry as dust. It used to be such a
[scl]nice place...[np]
[scl]Oh, I've talked your ears right~
[scl]off, haven't I.
[scl]Toodleloo~!
[en1]

I hear a lot of my friends out
[nl2]there...
[en2]

Something coming...
[en2]

[SMonkey2]Caww! Caaw![np]
[nl2]TL: A storm's brewin'! Take shelter!
[en2]

Look outside!
[nl2]You have to lock the wheel before
[nl3]we're swept away!
[en2]

Lock broken! Fix! Fix!
[en2]

It's not even winter...?
[en2]

Cold! Cold!
[en2]

It has to be a little cold!
[en2]

Excuse me...?
[nl2]You want to set me up with a girl
[nl3]who's "just my type"?![np]
[scl]
[scl]
[scl]I'm married, you know!
[en2]

Do something~!!
[en2]

Something block path!
[en2]

Maybe this is blocking our path?
[en2]

Ooo ooo![np]
[nl2]TL: Come here!
[nl3]   Fast! Fast!
[en2]

We're searching this island for
[nl2]some lost kids!
[nl3]Do you know anything about them?[np]
[scl]They were called [team] Team.
[scl]One of them even had a hat just
[scl]like that...[np]
[scl]...Hey?... You kids aren't...?
[en2]

We're back at the first island.
[en2]

[SP$0010][nl2]  ...I wonder how Polly is doing.
[en2]

...It seems like Polly might jump
[nl2]out at any moment.
[en2]

This robot and this whole island
[nl2]are pretty strange.[np]
[nl3]I have a weird feeling and can't
[scl]find those missing kids anywhere.
[en2]

It seems like stuff went to pot
[nl2]after we left...
[en2]

...There's no response.
[nl2]     ...It must be broken.
[en2]

...It seems like someone was
[nl2]growing tomatoes here.[np]
[nl3]I wonder if it's connected to this
[scl]case somehow.
[en2]

There's a path through here.
[nl2]It seems to lead to the opposite
[nl3]side of the island...[np]
[scl]But it's a pretty old road...
[en2]

The pipe is connected to the lake
[nl2]up there... When we came here, all
[nl3]the pipes were connected.[np]
[scl]But that'd make the lake water
[scl]run down to the ocean.
[scl]Why would someone do that?
[en2]

So you understand?
[nl2]Then don't get in the way of a
[nl3]man at work.
[en2]

This whole thing must be Bull's
[nl2]doing. His cohorts are keeping
[nl3]their mouths shut, though.
[en2]

So you want to go through here?
[nl2]You're need gonna need the
[nl3]colonel's express permission.
[en2]

Hurry up and put [X$6B] {L}{u}{c}{k} {R}{o}{c}{k}{s}
[nl2]in the furnace below!!
[en2]

Hurry and save Miss Gina!
[en2]

Push the lever!
[nl2]We have to save Miss Gina!
[en2]

We can handle things until we
[nl2]reach the island.[np]
[nl3]Why don'cha go outside and get
[scl]some fresh air, [team] Team?
[en2]

We can handle things until the
[nl2]next island!
[en2]

[team] Team!
[nl2]Pull the lever!!
[en2]

[nl2]          Team work!
[en2]

It seems that Pluck is on this
[nl2]ship, isn't he? [np]
[nl3]Tell him I'll visit him again
[scl]sometime.           ...Until then!
[en1]

Hurry. Push the lever!
[en2]

Fugo. Fugo. Fugogo.[np]
[nl2]TL: If you have something to say,
[nl3]   come a little closer.[np]
[scl]   I won't bite...

...Hey...
[nl2]Wasn't our teacher with you?
[nl3]...Who?... Miss Gina, duh!![np]
[scl]Don't make me say lame stuff like
[scl]that!
[en2]

By the way... What happened to
[nl2]Miss Gina? Wasn't she with you?
[nl3]...Is she really lost?!
[en2]

Oh, you guys are okay. 
[nl2]But... What about Miss Gina?
[nl3]Wasn't she with you?[np]
[scl]What? You want to go in the cave
[scl]ahead?[np]
[scl]...No way, it's too dangerous in
[scl]there. I can't let you kids go in
[scl]there all alone.
[en2]

By the way... 
[nl2]What happened to Miss Gina?
[nl3]Wasn't she with you?[np]
[scl]...She's actually missing?[np]
[scl]What? You want permission from
[scl]the Colonel to enter the cave?[np]
[scl]...What on earth?
[scl]...What's in the cave?
[scl]You can't tell me?
[scl]...Okay, just give me a minute.
[en1]

Get close and give it a good look.
[en2]

Ah, here's the Colonel's permission
[nl2]slip. Hmmm... "Mr. Arnold, Entry
[nl3]Allowed."[np]
[scl]So this is interesting... I think it's
[scl]actually saying the person holding
[scl]the note is allowed.. *wink*[np]
[scl]Are you kids really going to be
[scl]okay on your own?
[scl]...I see. Well, how's this.
[en1]

How about that?
[nl2]...If you get busted, make a quick
[nl3]get away.[np]
[scl]You only get one shot.
[scl]Make it count.

[nl3]This teacher is... He's quite a bit
[scl]mischievous, isn't he??
[en1]

You don't know anything about
[nl2]your teacher's whereabouts?
[nl3]...Nothing at all?[np]
[scl]You should tell me anything you
[scl]know!
[en2]

I get the sense you boys have an
[nl2]important task... I don't know what
[nl3]it could be... But give it your all!
[en2]

Mino! Minoo![np]
[nl2]TL: I... HATE... YOU! I'd rather give
[nl3]   my coat to anyone else!!
[en2]

[nl2] ...Umm...  It might be broken?
[en2]

Look at the door behind you.[np]
[nl2]That is the only way out of here.[np]
[nl3]You can't go back now.[np]
[scl]What will you do?[np]
[scl]              -Captain Maverick
[en1]

[X$6A]Good luck you guys! 
[nl2]Miss Gina is in your hands now!!
[en1]

...This egress shall remain closed
[nl2]for all of eternity. ...There shall
[nl3]be no escape for you.
[en2]

Take a look around the village.
[nl2]There should be a clue leading to
[nl3]the Crystal Ball!
[en1]

You should show those documents
[nl2]to some kind of plant expert.[np]
[nl3]Uh, me? I'm not really an expert,
[scl]you know...[np]
[scl]But...
[scl]          ...Aren't I a nice guy?!
[en1]

You know, withholding documents is
[nl2]very suspicious!
[en1]

To see the village manager, you'll
[nl2]need to call for a meeting.[np]
[nl3]If you place that wood splinter
[scl]back into the sign, you should be
[scl]able to figure out the number.
[en1]

Hurry and get back to the ship!
[nl3]If you want more {L}{u}{c}{k} {R}{o}{c}{k}{s}, look
[scl]for the monkeys on the island.[np]
[scl]Good luck~!
[en1]

If grass is blocking your path,
[nl2]kick it out of the way!
[en1]

I'll let you in on a secret!
[nl2]Everything has a weak point.[np]
[nl3]Just take a closer look at the
[scl]way things move.
[scl]I think you'll see what I mean!
[en1]

Hurry back to the village!
[nl2]Professor Marlowe has made a
[nl3]discovery!
[en1]

Why don't you try spraying various
[nl2]things?
[en1]

What's going on?
[nl2]Let's try asking Mr. Smith!
[en1]

Did you try recording a mouse's
[nl2]squeak?[np]
[nl3]If you play it for one of the
[scl]villagers, you might find out who
[scl]Mike is!
[en1]

The guy you met outside the cave
[nl2]was looking for you!
[en1]

Did you talk to all the villagers?
[nl3]Don't forget to check lots of
[scl]things with the [ABtn] button, too~!
[en1]

Instead of eating the meal
[nl2]yourselves... What if you tried to
[nl3]give it to someone else?[np]
[scl]It seems spicy, so they'll probably
[scl]need water afterward.[np]
[scl]Wasn't there some water
[scl]underground by the cacti?
[scl]It seemed like it was awfully salty
[scl]though!
[en1]

Wow, stuff is getting out of hand![np]
[nl2]After spraying the parasite with
[nl3]salt water, you can try punching
[scl]it with Max.[np]
[scl]If Max doesn't have Boxing Gloves,
[scl]you'll need to find some!
[en1]

Oh dear, did you look at the
[nl2]X-Ray? Jack, do something!
[en1]

Did you meet the tiny people who
[nl2]were attacked by an eagle?[np]
[nl3]I suspect they may be related to
[scl]Polly somehow!
[en1]

...Giant creatures are attacking the
[nl2]people on this island.[np]
[nl3]How did the bugs and other
[scl]animals get so be so huge?
[en1]

Boy, what a handful. We have to
[nl2]collect 5 objects...[np]
[nl3]For now, let's choose one of the
[scl]following 3 sets of objects:[np]
[scl]Frog Tail - Shell
[scl]Gold Drop - Coat
[scl]Silver Thread - Paints[X$6E]
[en1]

Frogs don't actually have tails
[nl2]once they've grown...[np]
[nl3]But the frog in the forest
[scl]cherishes his.[np]
[scl]If you listen to him and follow the
[scl]power cable to the castle, you will
[scl]find a way to solve his problem.[np]
[scl]Then convince him to give you his
[scl]treasure.[np]
[scl]As far as the Forest Shell, that's
[scl]a snail's shell. This is the season
[scl]snails like to change their homes.[np]
[scl]Answer the Roly-Poly's questions, 
[scl]and then find a house a snail
[scl]might like at the shop in the city.
[en1]

The {G}{o}{l}{d}{e}{n} {D}{r}{o}{p} refers to honey.
[nl2]There are 3 bees in the forest,
[nl3]and one of them is easily startled.[np]
[scl]You can scare him to get a drop,
[scl]but you need to watch where it
[scl]falls and remember the location.[np]
[scl]The Forest Coat is a bagworm's
[scl]shell.[np]
[scl]The bagworms in this forest are
[scl]very fashionable. They will throw
[scl]away their coat if it gets dirty.[np]
[scl]You should have an item for that,
[scl]right?
[en1]

There are 4 spiders in the forest
[nl2]who are also brothers. The oldest
[nl3]one is able to spin Silver Thread.[np]
[scl]However, he goes pretty berserk
[scl]when you touch his web, so you'll
[scl]need to watch out for his attack.[np]
[scl]You'll need to take a preemptive
[scl]strike at him as he charges.[np]
[scl]Once you've used an item to stun
[scl]him during his charge, you can use
[scl]another item to snag the Thread.[np]
[scl]You can then retrieve 3 paint sets
[scl]from the remaining spiders.
[scl]Eh? What's the paint for?[np]
[scl]You'd better just challenge the
[scl]spiders and get the paints.[np]
[scl]I'm sure it'll come in handy later
[scl]on. Just be sure to give each of
[scl]your special techniques a try.
[en1]

Do you know about the town's
[nl2]artist, Caesar?[np]
[nl3]You should bring him the paints
[scl]you got from the forest.[np]
[scl]Do you remember what the King's
[scl]gown looked like?[np]
[scl]If you haven't seen it, you'll need
[scl]to go and take a look.[np]
[scl]You may need to take a closer
[scl]look while he's taking a Shower.[np]
[scl]As for how to get him to go to
[scl]take a shower... Remember the
[scl]Frog in the forest?[np]
[scl]You'll need to get the King to
[scl]cooperate in the same way.[np]
[scl]The situation is a bit different, so
[scl]act accordingly.
[en1]

You've done a lot, but there's no
[nl2]trace of the Crystal Ball.[np]
[nl3]For the time being, perhaps you
[scl]should go talk to Solomon?
[en1]

Oh no~, it's awful.
[nl2]Polly is being held in the lowest
[nl3]level of the ant hill.[np]
[scl]You'll have to use the holes in the
[scl]ground to find the lower levels.
[scl]...Be careful of ants!
[en1]

Did you help the injured
[nl2]soldiers? Search the area near
[nl3]the soldiers.[np]
[scl]Don't you have a tool that can
[scl]dig holes?
[en1]

The little boy in town knows how
[nl2]to defeat a giant toy robot.[np]
[nl3]Your opening is when he turns to
[scl]the side.
[en1]

You must find holes leading down
[nl2]that the ants covered up. Think
[nl3]back to earlier in your journey.[np]
[scl]When you do, you'll realize how to
[scl]find the holes.
[en1]

You can't defeat the queen without
[nl2]a strong weapon from Hassan.
[nl3]Did you already receive it?
[en1]

It's time to wrap this up.
[nl2]The Eagle can carry the treasure
[nl3]away from the castle's garden.[np]
[scl]Do you remember what the Eagle
[scl]Egg looks like? Think back to what
[scl]you learned at Caesar's house.[np]
[scl]When you do, you'll remember the
[scl]painting order.
[en1]

What are you doing?
[nl2]You've saved Polly's kingdom, but
[nl3]you don't have the Crystal Ball.[np]
[scl]Find the real Eagle Egg and take
[scl]it to the Eagle.
[en1]

Hurry up and take the Egg to the
[nl2]Eagle. If you do, I'm sure he'll
[nl3]give you the Crystal Ball.
[en1]

There's nothing left to do on this
[nl2]island. Let's hurry up and get to
[nl3]the ship.[np]
[scl]We need to continue our journey!
[en1]

...Oh, Pluck! What happened to
[nl2]Pluck?! ...He's never here when you
[nl3]need him. Pluck!
[en1]

...Pluck. You have a lot of {L}{u}{c}{k}
[nl2]{R}{o}{c}{k}{s}, don't you?
[en1]

Eh!? Elder, how could you even
[nl2]suggest... I don't know anything
[nl3]about that!
[en1]

You fool!!
[nl2]Do you think I'm blind, you rascal?![np]
[nl3]Even if you have them, they won't
[scl]do anything for you.[np]
[scl]Use them so the humans can get
[scl]safely home, or else!!
[en1]

...Fine, just fine!
[nl2]...Darn, guess I can't fool the
[nl3]elder. I get it. I'll go do it now~.
[en1]

You're going to go fire up the
[nl2]engine? ...Why don't you leave it to
[nl3]me? Come with me, Jim!
[en1]

...It takes 3 of you?
[nl2]Don't worry, I'm at least as strong
[nl3]as two of you.
[en1]

...M-miss Gina...
[nl2]Leave it to me! Jim! Let's go!
[en1]

Arnold oughtta be ashamed of
[nl2]himself![np]
[nl3]Acting like that at his age...[np]
[scl]He must be in "L" with Miss Gina.
[en1]

[nl2]      Jiiiim! Get in here!!!
[en1]

Now we must say our farewells.
[nl2]It's not easy... But it can't be
[nl3]helped. Winky-! Come off the ship!
[en1]

What, you got something to say?
[nl2]From now on, I'm the main
[nl3]character![np]
[scl]Get ready for King Bull's story!
[en1]

What the heck? What's this!
[nl2]Hey, why is it getting smaller?!
[nl3]Stop it! Don't just end on me~!!
[en1]

[nl2]  ...Dang it~! I won't forget this!
[en1]

[nl2]...That's kinda fishy.
[en2]

Whoa! Well take a look at that![np]
[nl2]Does it look good?
[nl3][ ][ ][ ][ ]Yup.
[scl][ ][ ][ ][ ]I hate it.[X$68]
[en1]

What? Then show me something
[nl2]else.
[en2]

Alright! Another successful
[nl2]negotiation...
[en1]

That's weirder than my mom's
[nl2]hairstyle~!
[en2]

Could that person be...?
[nl2]No, it couldn't be. I'm sorry,
[nl3]forget I mentioned it.
[en2]

Our dad is cool, isn't he?
[en2]

Captain, forgive me!
[en2]

Benson, take care of these
[nl2]children, please!!
[en2]

Ah? Hey bro!
[nl2]Look at my boy!
[en1]

Don't forget that Miss Gina said
[nl2]all 3 of us have to stay together!
[en2]

Come closer and show it to me!
[en2]

...Anyhow, you've disgraced the
[nl2]royal family! You kids must face
[nl3]your punishment.
[en2]

It's a picture of Polly's dad, the
[nl2]King.
[en2]

Let's get close and check it out.
[en2]

This toy robot is enormous...
[en2]

...Whoops!
[nl2]Teamwork takes all 3 of us!
[en2]

They look impossible to move...
[en2]

If ma' dog eats anythin', he falls
[nl2]straight ta' sleep!
[en1]

[nl2]            Not!
[en2]

...Is he alive?
[nl2]Let's get closer and check.
[en2]

...It's a tomato.
[nl2]...That's a relief.
[en2]

Let's get closer and read it.
[en2]

Let's give it a closer look.
[en2]

...It's a strangely circular egg.
[en2]

By the way... Do you remember me?
[en2]

Hey, bro!
[en2]

[X$6A][SDenied]
[nl2]     You don't have items!
[en2]

Did you open the blue chest?[np]
[nl2]If you use what came out of it
[nl3]with [Item], you can control the
[scl]robot!
[en1]

Push the 4 switches inside the
[nl2]cave with [TWork]! Make the strongest
[nl3]boy the leader!
[en1]

Open the treasure chest and press
[nl2]the switch on the left.
[nl3]You know what I'm talking about?
[en1]

You can use the rope with [Item].[np]
[nl2]Use it near the pushable boulder!
[en1]

Use the mine cart in the cave to
[nl2]move forward![np]
[nl3]Ride the mine cart because I sure
[scl]won't be carrying you~!
[en1]

[nl2]  You're an embarrassment, Max.
[en2]

Did you go inside the mansion?[np]
[nl2]In there, you'll find a grandfather
[nl3]clock...[np]
[scl]According to Indio's memo, set it
[scl]to 9:30 and then 10:30.
[en1]

The person who came out of the
[nl2]clock was the man in the photo.[np]
[nl3]Which means, that room must be a
[scl]time room![np]
[scl]If you look around in there, maybe
[scl]you can find the time machine![np]
[scl]The purple clock looks pretty
[scl]suspicious~.
[en1]

Find the man from the lake and
[nl2]show him the penguin! He might be
[nl3]happy enough to give you a gift.
[en1]

Did you listen to Indio?
[nl2]I wonder what he'll say if you
[nl3]show him that photo.
[en1]

Did you show Benson the picture?
[nl2]I'm sure that will make him believe
[nl3]you.
[en1]

Benson knows all about the
[nl2]Mammoth Brothers, so why don't
[nl3]you ask him to show you around?
[en1]

Check for Benson's smoke signal.
[nl2]Use the telescope in the bandit
[nl3]hideout.[np]
[scl]Head wherever the his signal is.
[scl]Be sure to use teamwork~.
[en1]

Speaking of {L}{u}{c}{k} {R}{o}{c}{k}{s}, do you
[nl2]have a good stash? You'll need a
[nl3]lot to defeat the bandits.
[en1]

Check out the Mammoth Brothers
[nl2]with the [ABtn] button~!
[en1]

Benson's final words must be
[nl2]hidden in the village.[np]
[nl3]If you follow his instructions, you'll
[scl]find the Crystal Ball!
[en1]

Try talking to the man near the
[nl2]gorilla.
[en1]

There's a place to peek into John's
[nl2]house. Did you find it?
[nl3]Everyone has secrets!
[en1]

Are you stuck in the cave with
[nl2]the mice?[np]
[nl3]Try catching the daddy mouse like
[scl]a fish and then tug it gently.
[en1]

The Crystal Ball is in the
[nl2]underground cave!
[nl3]Hurry and get it!
[en1]

Don't forget to give Hassan the
[nl2]items you find in the forest~!
[en1]

You should dig here.
[en2]

This is too lame. Only old people
[nl2]like swing!
[en2]

Gramps might be happy to hear
[nl2]this...
[en2]

Find Hassan. He is in the ant
[nl2]colony somewhere.
[nl3]Maybe under a boulder.
[en1]

Noses, bird legs, ant legs, spider
[nl2]legs... Maybe they're numbers?
[en2]

Come closer.
[en2]

...Isn't what I should be saying
[nl2]now!
[en2]

It's a "Do Not Enter" sign.
[en2]

[nl2]     The guys from earlier?
[en2]

You're the oldest brother!
[en2]

[nl2]    Oh, he caught... something!
[en2]

You're the 2nd brother!
[en2]

It's a suspicious boulder. I think
[nl2]we could lift it if we work
[nl3]together...
[en2]

[nl2]   It's the monkey from before.
[en2]

{L}{u}{c}{k} {R}{o}{c}{k}{s} won't come out anymore.
[en2]

You're the youngest!
[en2]

Ooo, kii, kii, kii![np]
[nl2]TL: You're late! What's wrong?
[en2]

What are these boards?
[en2]

Huh? The footprints stop here.
[nl2]I wonder why?
[en2]

What is this?
[nl2]There are 4 handles.
[en2]

What's with this grass?
[nl2]It's dried out like a mummy.
[en2]

What a weird robot. It's sprinkling
[nl2]water like it's haywire.
[en2]

[nl2]Something's written on the ground...
[en2]

[nl2]Grr. Bark bark. Growl.
[en2]

[nl2]  You can't see what is written.
[en2]

[nl2] Hey! It's the Crystal Ball!
[en2]

It's a pipe.
[en2]

Water is pouring out.
[en2]

Now boys, try not to do anything
[nl2]too dangerous, alright?[np]
[nl3]You don't have to say anything.
[scl]I can see it in your eyes...
[en2]

Ah... So that means... You were
[nl2]worried, and now you've become a
[nl3]ghost to come check on me?!
[en2]

It's a strange rock that floats up
[nl2]and down!
[en2]

Thank you for collecting the
[nl2]{F}{i}{r}{e}{w}{o}{o}{d}, [team] Team.
[en2]

This pipe sure is in the way...
[en2]

What's this mark?
[en2]

The plant that attacked me was
[nl2]huge...!
[en2]

[nl2]      Huh? There's a hole.
[en2]

[nl2]        It's a sign!
[en2]

A treasure chest!!
[en2]

You got the {F}{i}{r}{e}{w}{o}{o}{d}!
[nl2]Dorothy just told me.
[en2]

The parasite has been cleansed
[nl2]from the Baobab tree.
[en2]

[nl2]  Too bad. The chest is empty.
[en2]

Why is there a door here?

[nl3]you're all together!

[en2]

Look! {F}{i}{r}{e}{w}{o}{o}{d}!
[en2]

[nl2] The picture said something?
[en2]

It's a picture of Pirate Bull's
[nl2]grandfather.
[en2]

That control panel is for the
[nl2]ship's engine.
[en2]

...What a large painting.
[en2]

I wonder what he'll pull up.
[en2]

Huh? Did you get [Six] pieces of
[nl2]{F}{i}{r}{e}{w}{o}{o}{d} yet, [team] Team?
[en2]

What is it?
[en2]

What's wrong, 'chitlins?

What do you brats want?
[nl2]You're jealous of my beauty so
[nl3]you came to steal our oil!?

Well, what do we have here?

[en2]

[nl2]Oh wow! It's smaller than a child!
[en2]

[nl2]        It's a cave.
[en2]

[nl2]     It's a large post.

It's a robot.

Didn't you hear me?[np]

Good eye there.

[nl2]    There's an entrance.

It's looks like an old mine cart...

It's a switch you can step on.

An old mine cart.

There's a hole big enough for a

The door is shut tightly.

There's a small hole.

Sorry, that pot is empty.[np]

[nl2]It's moving!!
[en2]

It's an X-Ray machine! ...I wonder

[en2]

Whoa! You there, did you find a
[nl2]rare plant?
[en2]

Hey, hey, let's play...
[nl2]Wanna play? Wanna play?
[en2]

It's a familiar-looking conveyor

What's with these footprints?...
[en2]

What is this plant?

What is this?

Something very powerful must have

What is that?
[en2]

It's a juke box! Isn't it nice to

[en2]

I think the way deeper into the

[X$6A]It's... Some kind of sexy gorilla...
[en2]

These monkeys are mean!
[nl2]They're not like Winky at all~.
[en2]

What's with these monkeys...?
[en2]

A fresh and feisty couple!

[X$6A]This one's a fake?!
[nl2]Which means... [SImprtnt]He's a plant!?
[en2]

[X$6A]This kid lives here?

There, there, stop crying... What

It looks dicey out there, so watch

[nl2]    Jeez! Embarrassed again!

Did you find Mr. Smith?

It's so dangerous outside, so I
[nl2]can't get any work done!
[nl3]...Well, what do you want?
[en2]

Ack! S-so spice-!! So spicey!!!!
[nl2]W-water~!!
[en2]

Haven't you seen a creepy plant
[nl2]somewhere else?
[en2]

It seems like this leads to the
[nl2]cave...
[en2]

It's the old man from the
[nl2]management office?
[en2]

[X$6A]Someone came out of the plant!
[nl2]Huh? It's Mr. Smith...
[nl3][np]
[scl]Wait, [SImprtnt]if this is Mr. Smith, then who
[scl]did we meet in the cave earlier!?
[en2]

Oh... We were too late! The key to
[nl2]the cave is already gone.
[nl3]...Who could have done this?
[en2]

Find the plant who turned into a
[nl2]person! He must be in the village,
[nl3]I'm sure of it!
[en2]

Pshaw...
[nl2]Someone told you I would be
[nl3]afraid of mice? How very silly...
[en2]

I didn't cower in fear at the
[nl2]sound of a mouse's squeak, got
[nl3]it, tubby?[np]
[scl]Hehehe... Okay, you want to know
[scl]how many townspeople there
[scl]are?[np]
[scl]Except myself and Mr. Smith,
[scl]there are [Eight] total townspeople.
[scl][Three] of the townspeople are women!
[en2]

"Smith's Journal" Is written on the
[nl2]cover...
[en2]

There's a hole here?
[en2]

It's a loud, squeaky mouse.
[en2]

There's trouble, man... I was
[nl2]working inside, and then suddenly,
[nl3]Mr. Smith came after me!
[en2]

Who are you kids...?!
[en2]

Grr~! Bark bark ruff!!
[en2]

Why is a plant growing here??
[en2]

A dog's corpse came out...
[nl2][SImprtnt]The collar is the same as the dog
[nl3]that attacked us...!
[en2]

There might be a prize for taking
[nl2]down Bob, you know.
[en2]

[SStop]Wash the shame off your face and
[nl2]come back later!
[nl3]I'll take those gloves back, too!

The ship has stopped safely.

Wait! Stop right there, travelers.[np]

How could Polly be kidnapped by
[nl2]such dumb kids...[np]
[nl3]Well, at least now she should know
[scl]that the stories are lies.
[scl]There're no such things as Giants...
[en2]

If you were just Giants, how did
[nl2]you become tiny like us?
[nl3]It's unbelievable.
[en2]

I am sure you were Giants.
[nl2]Maybe it was a bad dream.
[en2]

Maybe the reason you guys shrunk
[nl2]is the same reason everything
[nl3]around this castle is huge...?
[en2]

These stairs lead to Princess
[nl2]Polly's room. Without Solomon's
[nl3]permission you can't enter.
[en2]

This stairway leads to the
[nl2]dungeon. Without Hassan's
[nl3]permission you may not enter.
[en2]

Criminals must not be allowed to
[nl2]escape.
[nl3]Quietly await your judgement.
[en2]

What are you doing?
[nl2]Follow Hassan's orders.
[en2]

Look at the creatures in the cell
[nl2]there. They're the {B}{l}{u}{e} {T}{h}{i}{n}{g}{s}... 
[nl3]Giant ants.
[en2]

I've been searching for a way to
[nl2]defeat the {B}{l}{u}{e} {T}{h}{i}{n}{g}{s} for a
[nl3]long time.[np]
[scl]I think I've finally found a solution.
[en2]

Choose who you will leave behind.
[nl2]If you drag your feet, the "Blue
[nl3]Things" will come and destroy us!
[en2]

Don't worry about whoever you
[nl2]leave behind. This dungeon is MUCH
[nl3]safer than the forest.
[en2]

It's a giant ant!
[nl2]How could an ant get so big?
[en2]

Hassan is the greatest scientist in
[nl2]the kingdom.
[en2]

The forest is outside the castle
[nl2]and to the west.
[en2]

The King is taking a little nap.
[nl2]Don't make a ruckus!
[en2]

This gate leads to the forest.
[en2]

This gate leads to the "Blue
[nl2]Thing" colony. Those without the
[nl3]King's permission may not pass.

This gate leads outside.

All these kids keep coming in here
[nl2]for the free bonus toy.[np]
[nl3]Every caramel comes with a
[scl]"Great Mecha" toy.[np]
[scl]Apparently, "Great Mecha" is
[scl]popular with the kids nowadays.
[en2]

Go, Great Mecha #3!!
[nl2]Giga-giga-gigachaaan~!
[nl3]Buh-BOOM!
[en2]

Like my Great Mecha #3?
[nl2]It moves all on its own.
[nl3]Pretty cool, right?[np]
[scl]But it's mine, so don't get all
[scl]touchy now, ya hear?
[en2]

Next is[team] Team!
[nl2]Up first for[team] team, we
[nl3]have the ever-energetic, {D}{e}{o}{n}!
[en1]

Now, I'll pick the team leader.
[nl2]Hmmm, is it okay if I make Deon
[nl3]the leader for now?[np]
[scl]Okay then, as the leader, you get
[scl]to wear this!
[en1]

Ooh, looking sharp. You can change
[nl2]the leader with [RBtn]. So, decide
[nl3]amongst yourselves who'll lead.
[en1]

The most important thing about
[nl2]camping is teamwork.[np]
[nl3]Don't forget that all 3 of you
[scl]need to work together.[np]
[scl]Press the [YBtn] button to blow
[scl]your whistle and gather up.
[en2]

Hot dang that is a dorky hat.
[nl2]Haha. Did you suck up to the
[nl3]teacher to get it?[np]
[scl]Camping is so stupid I can't stand
[scl]it. Ugh! Why do I have to be in
[scl]charge of fishing?[np]
[scl]That teach' makes me so mad!
[en2]

Eh? Well if it isn't [team] Team.
[nl2]Wanna know a secret?
[nl3]Come closer and I'll tell you.
[en2]

Hey,[team] Team, can't you do
[nl2]anything about Jim? Somebody
[nl3]needs to put him in his place.
[en2]

Oh? You think you can take
[nl2]me?! Haha, give it your best shot.
[en2]

Hey, hey, hey! Hurry up and kick.
[nl2]We're not done yet.
[en2]

It's a switch that you press from
[nl2]above.
[en2]

It worked!
[nl2]...We knew you'd come for that
[nl3]woman no matter what.
[en2]

Is everyone okay?... Good.
[nl2]Me?... I'm fine.
[en2]

N...Nice work. You're the first to
[nl2]ever beat my iron guard.[np]
[nl3]What? You want a "prize"? ...Those
[scl]idiots and their promises... [np]
[scl]Fine, a man doesn't go back on his
[scl]word. ...This is all I have, alright?[np]
[scl]I'll give it to... That lanky fiend,
[scl]Jack. Take it.
[en2]

Good one! Cool, huh? Jim wasn't
[nl2]mad that I made the promise?
[en2]

Hehehe... Feelin' good!
[en2]

Ah, crap~. What should I do...?
[en2]

Go[team] Team go![np]
[nl2]For the beauty of your teacher[~]!
[nl3]Fight, fight, [team] Team!
[en2]

This boulder... 
[nl2]Looks sorta like a skull.
[nl3]It's a bit suspicious looking.
[en2]

It looks like this box is blocking
[nl2]the exit.[np]
[nl3]I don't really know what's up, but
[scl]I feel bad for the monkeys.
[en2]

[X$6A]...H, Hello?
[nl2]Nuts, no answer.
[en2]

This door looks awfully rusty...
[nl2]It seems quite old.
[en2]

I'll take revenge for my friend!
[nl2]En garde! En garde!
[en2]

[X$6A]Oh, the shame!
[nl2]It's so frustrating to lose to the
[nl3]enemy in a place like this.
[en2]

This is where the soldier was.
[nl2]Hm? Something's not quite right.
[en2]

What could it be?
[en2]

There's some kind of hole in the
[nl2]ground here...?
[en2]

A rusty robot!? ...Does it still
[nl2]work?
[en2]

Hey, give it a try.
[nl2]Maybe... We can't leave until the
[nl3]blue box is opened.
[en2]

What's the matter? I wonder if
[nl2]we're lost?
[en2]

...Crap! You knew? Fine, a promise
[nl2]is a promise. Wait here.
[en1]

Hey,[team] Team, I heard
[nl2]you're collecting the {F}{i}{r}{e}{w}{o}{o}{d}.
[en2]

Hey![team] Team! Great timing.
[nl2]We were putting water in this
[nl3]pot, but we put in too much.[np]
[scl]Now we can't move it~!
[en2]

[nl2]     Let's use [TWork]!
[en2]

...What's this?
[en2]

There's a trick to catching fish.
[nl2]...Want me to tell you?
[en2]

[nl2]Hey![team] Team!
[nl3]               [np]
[scl]It was getting late, so I came
[scl]looking for you[~]. What are you
[scl]boys doing way out here[~]?[np]
[scl]You'll give me a heart attack,
[scl]you know[~].
[en1]

What are you doing?
[nl2]You still have a chance.
[en2]

[nl2]W-what's this?
[en2]

B-bad news~! Miss Gina was
[nl2]kidnapped by pirates!
[en2]

Hffeeggghhh! Mnnffgh!
[nl2]Ffnngggrrrfph-! Fungo-!
[en2]

What's wrong with you? Hurry up
[nl2]and take off these chains!
[en2]

What's wrong?
[nl2]You still have 1 chance left.
[en2]

What could this be?
[en2]

It changes direction if you don't
[nl2]hold it steady... What a pain!!
[en2]

Huh?! Something's not right!
[en2]

How careless.
[nl2]Let's nab the rest!
[en1]

How careless.
[nl2]Let's take them to the Cap'n!
[en1]

I'm the greatest pirate under the
[nl2]sky, King Bull![np]
[nl3]I'm so spectacular, bawling
[scl]children stop crying and stare in
[scl]awe when they see me.[np]
[scl]If you don't give me what I want,
[scl]your pretty little teacher will
[scl]walk the plank.[np]
[scl]You kids too terrified to talk?
[scl]Don't try to play dumb with me,
[scl]I know you guys took it!
[en1]

Kids, lemme tell you one thing:
[nl2]stay away from that mansion.
[en2]

What do you want? I'm busy now,
[nl2]so could you leave me alone?
[en2]

Only one Crystal Ball isn't enough...
[nl2]Or so it seems...
[en2]

What in the world is going on?
[en2]

[SP$011A][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ] Now's our chance!
[nl2][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][Space4]Get the bilge rats!
[en1]

It's a mechanical door...
[nl2]It's awfully old, but it seems to
[nl3]still be functional.
[en2]

Hey! The Patchies!!
[en2]

...I must be a little too heavy.
[nl2]You kids go on ahead. Don't worry
[nl3]about me.   ...I'll be okay...
[en2]

Tomatoes: Full of nutrients and
[nl2]good for your body! To-ma-toes~!
[en2]

Phooey! Don't think we'll just let
[nl2]you slide on by!!
[en1]

Don't even think about it!
[en1]

A strange door!
[en2]

Wow~!
[nl2]This is pretty sturdy!
[en2]

It's a huge log!
[en2]

Huh? What does this say...
[en2]

What happened?
[nl2]Your teacher came rushing out.
[en2]

[X$6A]T-the p-picture t-talked!
[nl2]G-g-g-g-ghost!
[nl3]It's a g-g-g-ghost!!
[en2]

Hmph! Don't get the wrong idea.
[nl3]I would never team up with scum
[scl]like you! Not in 100 years!
[en2]

You want me to go with you?
[nl2]Don't be daft, a captain goes
[nl3]down with his ship!
[en2]

[nl2]The wall here seems new.
[en2]

[nl2]Shh! Be silent!
[en2]

[nl2]It's an old journal.
[en2]

[nl2]Hey~, is that funny?
[en2]

Very big clocks~.
[nl2]Grandfather clocks~[~].
[nl3]NOW.   THEY'RE.   GONE!
[en2]

[nl2]   I've been waiting! I'm here!
[en2]

There are stairs up here...
[en2]

I'm so excited.
[nl2]My heart is pounding.
[en2]

Haha, I got you good! These pop
[nl2]when they're hit from above.
[nl3]They don't hurt, so don't worry.
[en2]

This is my friend, a migratory
[nl2]bird. He was just coming to visit
[nl3]me. Hey, say hello.
[en1]

Something was under the grave
[nl2]stone.
[en1]

[F2]Got a Mysterious, {O}{l}{d} {P}{h}{o}{t}{o}{g}{r}{a}{p}{h}!
[en1]

This sure is an old photo...
[nl2]Who could these people be...?
[nl3]And what's that guy holding?[np]
[scl]Could it be...!
[scl]The people in town might know
[scl]more.
[en2]

Listen to me~!
[nl2]This was a lively town until the
[nl3]bandits attacked.[np]
[scl]Now our crops~ won't even grow!
[en2]

The grave off on its own is where
[nl2]Indio, the leader of the mountain
[nl3]bandits, rests.[np]
[scl]He was arrested right away, but
[scl]we never recovered the "Town's
[scl]Treasure"...
[en2]

Hrrrmm... That woman's child was
[nl2]kidnapped by Indio's daughter, or
[nl3]so it rightly seems...[np]
[scl]The girl lives out East of Death
[scl]Lake o'er yonder...[np]
[scl]But e'en just the name gives me
[scl]the tootin' willies, so I'm a'ferd I 
[scl]won't be goin' any time soon...[np]
[scl]Will ya go in my stead?[np]
[scl]I rightly doubt Indio's daughter
[scl]means the child ny' harm, but just
[scl]ta' be on the safe side...[np]
[scl]Tha entrance ta' Death Lake is
[scl]guarded by ma' dog, but don't ya'
[scl]worry.[np]
[scl]Just toss im' a bone and he'll fall
[scl]right asleep. ..."wa-lllla~!"
[en1]

I'm the sheriff 'round these parts.
[nl2]That woman o'er thar seems to be
[nl3]in a heap o'trouble.
[en2]

Did you find the little chickabiddy?
[nl2]He's with Indio's kin on the 'orr
[nl3]side a' {D}{e}{a}{t}{h} {L}{a}{k}{e}.
[en2]

What?! You lost the fixin's?
[nl2]Well fine~.           ...Take this!
[en1]

Please, save my child!
[nl2]He would never wander into 
[nl3]{D}{e}{a}{t}{h} {L}{a}{k}{e} on his own.[np]
[scl]I'm sure Indio's daughter must
[scl]have kidnapped him![np]
[scl]Her father was the leader of the
[scl]bandits, after all.
[en2]

Hello my little travelers, how are
[nl2]you feeling today? This town used
[nl3]to be a pirate port.
[en2]

That old thing?
[en2]

It's an air balloon! There's a
[nl2]basket at the bottom.
[en2]

Did you boys get rid of the
[nl2]mutant flowers...? Wow![np]
[nl3]This boy was trying to find me
[scl]and got lost in Death Lake...[np]
[scl]I found him and brought him back
[scl]here, but we were trapped.[np]
[scl]Thanks to you, now he can go
[scl]home safely.
[en2]

People in town always bad mouth
[nl2]Miss Sisko, but she's not a bad
[nl3]person![np]
[scl]She teaches me loads of good
[scl]stuff!
[en2]

Don't mind what he said. The
[nl2]people of this town think my
[nl3]father stole their treasure.[np]
[scl]But, I've long believed my father
[scl]to be innocent of the crime.[np]
[scl]Still, no one will even visit his
[scl]grave... Only his pet crow keeps
[scl]him company.[np]
[scl]...I have a favor to ask you boys.
[scl]Could you please take these
[scl]flowers to his grave?
[en1]

He didn't mean anything by it.
[en2]

Did you take flowers to my
[nl2]father's grave?[np]
[nl3]I'm sure the crow will remember
[scl]me if you show him the flowers.
[en2]

Thank you! Thank you![np]
[nl2]It was Miss Sisko, wasn't it?
[nl3]The apple doesn't fall far from
[scl]the tree, does it?
[en2]

Please, guys!!
[nl2]Tell everyone that Miss Sisko isn't
[nl3]a bad person~!
[en2]

Thanks, pardners![np]
[nl2]If anything else goes awry, be
[nl3]sure to come on back y'hear!
[en2]

[SMonkey2]Caw caw![np]
[nl2]TL: No one is getting near this
[nl3]   grave!
[en2]

It says: "The hero who protected
[nl2]our town, Christopher Benson, rests
[nl3]here."
[en2]

"Grave of the Super-Evil Bandit,
[nl2]Indio." ...Is written here.
[nl3][np]
[scl]...What? Why would they...?
[en2]

Something came out of the grave.
[nl2]It looks like a picture...
[en2]

This is a mysterious and rather
[nl2]spooky house without an entrance.[np]
[nl3]Speaking of that... in the dead of
[scl]night, you can hear clocks chiming
[scl]in the mansion East of here.[np]
[scl]It's said that the ghost of Chris
[scl]Benson can be seen wandering the
[scl]halls at night.[np]
[scl]          ...Creepy stuff, right?
[en2]

Things were so much better back
[nl2]in the day. We were pirates and
[nl3]the grass was green.[np]
[scl]Then the bandits took our
[scl]"Treasure" and it all went to
[scl]pot...
[en2]

This is the only water in town.
[nl2]I should've listened to Indio and
[nl3]dug more wells...
[en2]

A long time ago I came up with a
[nl2]design for a digging machine, but I
[nl3]lost the blueprints...[np]
[scl]So the parts for it are now just
[scl]a pile of junk!
[scl]Take it if you'd like.
[en2]

This dog is in the way...
[en2]

The dog fell fast asleep after
[nl2]eating! I don't think he'll be up
[nl3]any time soon...
[en2]

It's a dog food dish.
[en2]

[F2]Received {F}{l}{o}{w}{e}{r}{s} from Miss Sisko!!
[nl3]Oh, Looks like she's pretty crafty!
[en1]

The {T}{i}{m}{e} {R}{o}{o}{m} is in the locked
[nl2]mansion. The old woman living next
[nl3]door has the keys.
[en2]

There's a picture here.
[en2]

Wassat? You boys want to see
[nl2]inside the mansion next door?
[en2]

Long ago, Indio and my husband
[nl2]were working together on some
[nl3]important project next door.
[en2]

Yarr! We be the pirate Patchie
[nl2]Brothers! Ye' be pretty foolhardy
[nl3]to have fallen into our trap.[np]
[scl]Don't hang the jib, lad!
[scl]If ye' want out, ye' got to
[scl]guess our ages in order![np]
[scl]Savvy? Here we go.
[en2]

I told you guys to stay out of
[nl2]here! I gave you your honey,
[nl3]didn't I?
[en2]

It'll take a lot of {F}{i}{r}{e}{w}{o}{o}{d} to
[nl2]heat up this giant pot.
[en2]

It's sort of sad to see our hard
[nl2]work go up in flames...
[en2]

The fire went out.
[nl2]I don't think the cooking finished.
[en2]

This rock can be moved by just 1
[nl2]person.

[scl]                ...For a price!
[en1]

We can use this to pump hot air

[en2]

The mast is broken at the base.
[nl2]What could have caused this...?
[en2]

This mermaid statue is made out
[nl2]of gold! It's... Gold!!
[en2]

If there's a smoke stack, there
[nl2]must be an engine down below.
[en2]

If we move this, the engine will
[nl2]start...
[en2]

This must be the engine...!
[en2]

This must be connected to the
[nl2]engine.

I already got bored of soccer.

[scl]Wanna play?

Oh! You came.
[nl2]Come a little closer so we can

There are 3 chests.

[scl]She wishes to march against the

Hehehe. We're doing a PK shootout.
[nl2]Want to challenge Jim? The rules
[nl3]are simple.[np]

Hurry up and kick it!
[nl2]Stop dawdling!

It's not like I really lost to you.
[nl2]There were... circumstances!
[nl3]Just take it and get out of here!
[en1]

Just take it.
[en1]

You guys are looking for {F}{i}{r}{e}{w}{o}{o}{d},
[nl2]right? I saw some north end of
[nl3]the lake.
[en2]

[X$6A]It's a soccer ball. Who would play
[nl2]soccer all the way out here?
[en2]

The door is locked.

It's a switch you can step on.
[en2]

Please listen to me-![np]
[nl2]Everyone in town says they've seen
[nl3]a ghost, but something worse is
[scl]going on!
[en2]

I heard that house with no one in
[nl2]it is haunted by a ghost...
[nl3]I wonder if it's true.
[en2]

A... A g-g-ghost c-c-came out...!
[nl2]Of that... empty house...
[en2]

Rumor has it that a pirate ghost
[nl2]has appeared. Now, the whole
[nl3]town's in a tizzy about it.[np]
[scl]It's shameful, but can't be helped.
[en2]

Everyone is freaking out over the
[nl2]pirate ghost!
[en2]

Listen to this! The ghost of my
[nl2]husband was worried about me
[nl3]and visited.[np]
[scl]As soon as he saw my face, he
[scl]must have been relieved and so he
[scl]disappeared.
[en2]

We just got done handling a
[nl2]kidnapping case, and now a ghost
[nl3]has begun terrorizing the town.[np]
[scl]What is going on here~?!
[en2]

It seems a ghost has appeared!
[nl2]It must be someone's idea of a
[nl3]joke.
[en2]

They say there's a ghost in town!
[en2]

Wha-? It's someone's shadow...
[nl2]Who's there?!
[en2]

I'm not a ghost or a suspicious
[nl2]person!
[en2]

We've got to hurry up! Let's get
[nl2]the Crystal Ball back from the
[nl3]Mammoth Brothers!!
[en2]

I'm sure the secret entrance was
[nl2]around here...?
[en2]

It seems... The entrance is blocked.
[en2]

This way is completely blocked.
[nl2]We'll have to find another
[nl3]entrance...[np]
[scl]I'm sure there was another one
[scl]around here somewhere.
[en2]

Whoa! That's a nice bod~!
[en2]

Darn! I was attacked by bandits![np]
[nl2]I'll catch a cold like this~.
[en2]

The Indio family moved into the

[nl3]The dad seems a little out there!

My son has been wearing the

[nl3]Whose fashion is he copying...?
[en2]

Why don't you kids work for me?
[nl2]I'll call you three "Patchies"!

My daddy isn't here right now!

That's a bird egg my father

[nl2]Yay~! Hooray~! Wow!

This mutant flower has very

This part seems to be the root.
[nl2]I wonder which flower is connected
[nl3]to it?

The petals were protecting this
[nl2]part! Isn't there some way we can
[nl3]attack it?

Oh man...
[nl2]Do you guys know where Indio is?
[nl3]Can you help me find him?!
[en2]

Was Indio really arrested for
[nl2]stealing the "town's treasure"?
[nl3]What's the Sheriff got on him?
[en2]

Hey, that's a penguin! If you dig
[nl2]where he leaves his mark, you'll
[nl3]hit water for sure.

According to my calculation, we need
[nl2]about [Three] wells to support this
[nl3]town.[np]

[scl]Were you the ones who rescued
[scl]me? In order for me to prove my
[scl]innocence, I have to stay here.[np]
[scl]The guys who stole the "town's
[scl]treasure" are in their mountain
[scl]hideout.[np]
[scl]They're called the "Mammoth
[scl]Brothers." You need to alert
[scl]Benson straight away![np]
[scl]He'll help you take care of the
[scl]bandits! Oh...? Benson...?[np]
[scl]He's tall and his face is...
[scl]Oh, I'm sure you'll regognize him
[scl]from my description...
[en2]

Please alert Benson about the
[nl2]Mammoth Brothers right away!
[en2]

Don't worry about me.
[nl2]You've got to get the Crystal Ball
[nl3]back from the bandits!
[en2]

I've started building a new house,
[nl2]but I can't decide which design to
[nl3]use!
[en2]

I think I'll do what you say and
[nl2]build House [One2]!
[en2]

What are you doing?
[nl2]Did you forget how to start the
[nl3]ship's engine?
[en2]

I'm sure the entrance was around
[nl2]here... Those Mammoth jerks must
[nl3]have sealed it up![np]
[scl]...Times like these call for a
[scl]creative solution!
[en1]

It'll just take one blast from this
[nl2]dynamite. Here, take it!
[en1]

This looks awfully familiar...?
[en2]

Chirp. Chirp, chii.[np]
[nl2]TL: What are you doing?
[nl3]   Just do it like before.
[en2]

This rock seems a bit more loose
[nl2]than the rest...
[nl3]Let's try the dynamite here!
[en2]

I'll go on ahead into the {M}{a}{m}{m}{o}{t}{h}
[nl2]{B}{r}{o}{t}{h}{e}{r}{s}' hideout.[np]
[nl3]I'll leave some smoke signals for
[scl]you guys to follow. I'll just need
[scl]to have my {D}{y}{n}{a}{m}{i}{t}{e} back!
[en2]

We're the Mammoth Bandits!
[nl2]With our masks on, we can handle
[nl3]anything!
[en2]

What is this switch for?
[en2]

This stone has a bandit's face
[nl2]carved in it...
[en2]

It looks like a ladder, but this
[nl2]rock leads somewhere.
[en2]

It seems there used to be a
[nl2]bridge here...
[en2]

This rock has a crack...!?
[en2]

The lazy, lucky otters are lounging
[nl2]with {L}{u}{c}{k} {R}{o}{c}{k}{s}!
[nl3]...Ouch, I bit my tongue!
[en2]

The otters have tomatoes!
[en2]

Hey~, help me! The Mammoth
[nl2]Brothers caught me! Please push
[nl3]the buttons in front of you!
[en2]

Wh, wh, what!? What was that!?
[nl2]We're the Mammoth Brothers! We
[nl3]defeat our enemies leader first!
[en2]

Huh?
[nl2]
[nl3]Where did the leader run off to!?
[en2]

He's unconscious.
[en2]

Be careful!!
[nl2]You can't hurt them while they're
[nl3]spinning.
[en2]

Hurry, push the buttons in front
[nl2]of the cage and save me!!
[en2]

Thank you!
[nl2]Now the "town's treasure" can be
[nl3]returned!
[en1]

[SP$000B]You came here looking for this
[nl2]{B}{l}{u}{e} {C}{r}{y}{s}{t}{a}{l}, right?[np]
[nl3]I apologize, but you can't have it
[scl]until I've proven Indio innocent.[np]
[scl]I promise I'll let you have it in
[scl]the future. Go ahead and return
[scl]to wherever you came from.
[en2]

I'll make sure you guys get the
[nl2]{B}{l}{u}{e} {C}{r}{y}{s}{t}{a}{l}. Go on and head
[nl3]back to wherever you're from.
[en2]

"The grave of the town's hero,
[nl2]Indio."       ...Is enscribed here.
[en2]

"The grave of the town's hero,
[nl2]Benson."      ...Is enscribed here.[np]
[nl3]Hey! What's this?...
[en2]

There is a mark left here...
[en2]

It's the crow from the cemetery!
[en2]

It's Indio, from the picture!
[nl2]...Does that mean we went back in
[nl3]time?!
[en2]

This is the second crystal!! It's
[nl2]moving in time with Indio's flute...
[en2]

"Due to unknown whereabouts of
[nl2]the pirate ship, entry is
[nl3]forbidden." ...Is written here.
[en2]

They've been born!
[nl2]They've been born!
[nl3]Now we've got triplets!
[en2]

I just had babies!
[nl2]I just gave birth!
[nl3]Now we've got triplets!
[en2]

Aren't these the Patchies?
[en2]

All of those books are about
[nl2]pirates...?
[en2]

It's a model of a pirate ship!
[en2]

Granny's bed, maybe?
[en2]

It's covered with spider webs now,
[nl2]but maybe they used it back when
[nl3]they were pirates.
[en2]

It's a wooden bucket. Is it used
[nl2]for cleaning?
[en2]

This is so old~!
[en2]

Granny's chair, I guess?
[en2]

What a fancy rug...!
[en2]

There's a hole...
[en2]

Ribbit. Ribbit.[np]
[nl2]TL: Man, how pathetic was that
[nl3]   guy? What a pansy, ribbit!

My child just loves Miss Sisko's
[nl2]classes. She's such a good
[nl3]teacher.
[en2]

Thanks to Sisko's father, this town
[nl2]has plenty of water...
[en2]

Indio and Christopher Benson
[nl2]saved our town.
[nl3]Their graves always have visitors!
[en2]

My husband was a great man. His
[nl2]grave is in the cemetery near
[nl3]town... Go see him if you'd like.
[en2]

I'm so happy to live in this
[nl2]beautiful town!
[en2]

The fancy graves in the west are
[nl2]for Benson and Indio.[np]
[nl3]They defended the village from
[scl]bandits a long time ago!
[en2]

I'm a teacher in this town.
[nl2]My name is Sisko.
[nl3]Where are you boys from?[np]
[scl]If you don't hurry back, your
[scl]teacher will be worried![np]
[scl]Teachers are always concerned for
[scl]their children, so be good and go
[scl]back soon![np]
[scl]But it's strange, when I see you
[scl]kids, I feel like this isn't the first
[scl]time we've met.
[en1]

Oh no! Class is about to start!
[en1]

Are you playing?
[en2]

Class is starting soon.
[en2]

Class is starting soon!!
[en2]

Are you studying?
[en2]

Miss Sisko is in the middle of
[nl2]class!
[en2]

Miss Sisko is in class!
[en2]

Oh my, you kids!
[nl2]Hurry up and head home, your
[nl3]teacher must be worried sick!
[en2]

Look, look! It's the home of my
[nl2]dreams!
[en2]

Everything used to be better...
[nl2]Isn't something I think about
[nl3]saying all the time!
[en2]

Look how small it became...

Minoo! Miinoo.[np]
[nl2]TL: You're going to spray me
[nl3]   again, aren't you!?

He's playing with some yarn.
[en2]

It's the grave of someone from
[nl2]town.
[en2]

Wow! It's Benson's ghost!
[nl2]It looks like it wants to tell us
[nl3]something...
[en2]

It's huge~! It must belong to her
[nl2]father.
[en2]

What long arrows~.
[en2]

It's so pretty...
[nl2]It's made from feathers.
[en2]

It's made from large feathers.
[en2]

I've seen this before somewhere...
[en2]

A pirate flag!
[nl2]But, it looks like a cheap souvenir.
[en2]

Ooh! Treasure chests!
[en2]

It's made from gold! We're rich~!
[en2]

This must be some kind of pirate...
[en2]

Maybe this is Bull and his mom...
[en2]

This tombstone is the only one
[nl2]without a name...
[en2]

A black stone...
[nl2]There's one North, South, East,
[nl3]and West...

Pegi, pegi, pegi~.[np]
[nl2]TL: This is the life~.

Did you find all the {F}{i}{r}{e}{w}{o}{o}{d}?[np]
[nl2]I, Dorothy of Girl Power Team,
[nl3]have offered to make food for
[scl]you peons...[np]
[scl]But I can't do it if you won't
[scl]bring me {F}{i}{r}{e}{w}{o}{o}{d}!
[en2]

What, you kids again?
[nl2]You can't enter the Archive Room
[nl3]while Hassan is out.
[en2]

This is the entrance to the
[nl2]castle's back garden.[np]
[nl3]It's a secret place that no one
[scl]except the King, and not even
[scl]Polly, can enter.
[en2]

It's a {T}{a}{p}{e} {R}{e}{c}{o}{r}{d}{e}{r}.
[en2]

Maybe we can record animal
[nl2]noises?
[en2]

Great Mecha #3, transform!
[nl2]Gigachan, gigachan, shakin!
[nl3]Bababa-Babooom!...
[en2]

It doesn't transform after all.

[SMonkey2]Kuu kukukee ko![np]
[nl2]TL: Stop that-!
[nl3]   It's my weak point~!

There is a {L}{u}{c}{k} {R}{o}{c}{k} mark here.
[en2]

Ooh, it's burning up!
[en2]

There are lots of rocks here.
[en2]

If you want some "Soccer Shoes,"
[nl2]I'll give you mine!! Except Jim
[nl3]threw them in the lake...
[en2]

There are shoes under the water.
[nl2]They still look pretty new...
[nl3]What a waste~.[np]
[scl]Maybe we should help ourselves to
[scl]them?
[en2]

There is a trick to teamwork.
[nl2]That trick is...
[en2]

How long will it take for the
[nl2]water to fill up...?
[en2]

If you want to know about
[nl2]teamwork, ask our leader.
[en2]

It's a big pot.
[nl2]Can it be moved?
[en2]

Well, they're sort of wet.
[nl2]If you walk around in them a bit
[nl3]they should dry out.[np]
[scl]Don't catch a cold now~.
[en2]

Shh~! If you make any loud noises,
[nl2]you'll scare the fish off!
[nl3]Move like a ninja...
[en2]

Stop spacing out over there and
[nl2]come help me pull this!
[en2]

Isn't there someone a little
[nl2]stronger?

Thanks! Pull on 1, 2,[Space4][Three]!

Is something written on the
[nl2]blackboard...?
[en2]

...?!...A mouse!
[en2]

The tent is open a little bit here.
[nl2]The mouse must have gone in
[nl3]through here. Which means...
[en2]

Kyaaaa--!! H-help! A mouse!
[nl2]I hate mice~!! Aaaaah--!
[en2]

...!...The mouse!? It's gone already?
[nl2]...Phew. ...You know... I hate mice.
[nl3]How did it even get in here?[np]
[scl]It's scary knowing that a mouse
[scl]could appear at any second...
[scl]Your teacher's anxious.
[en2]

The tent is open a little bit here.
[nl2]The mouse must have gone in
[nl3]through here. Which means...
[en2]

...Huh?
[nl2]I don't see a mouse anywhere.
[en2]

...?...The mouse came out.
[nl2]Let's investigate closely!
[en2]

...!... Where's the mouse?
[nl2]...Oh, it ran away? Thank goodness.
[nl3]Let me show my gratitude.[np]

Thank you. It seems the mouse

[scl]you my spare scarf.[np]
[scl]Keep it a secret from the other
[scl]teams, okay?[np]
[scl]When you're feeling overwhelmed,
[scl]look at this and remember me.
[en1]

There's a wooden box with an
[nl2]open lid. What's it for?
[en2]

I invented that box.
[nl2]I call it the "Item Poof Box."
[nl3]Care to try it?[np]
[scl]Press [ABtn] on [Item] and then choose
[scl]the item you want to put in.
[scl]What happens next is a surprise!

Ah! The {L}{u}{c}{k} {R}{o}{c}{k} is floating
[nl2]away.

The {L}{u}{c}{k} {R}{o}{c}{k} sank.

Huh!?

Heyy~. Nice shot, man!

3 pegs are sticking out of this

Clean windows give a great

[en2]

This is a pretty nice place.

Stop! No further!

A control explanation is written on

[nl2]You pretended to be giants and
[nl3]kidnapped Princess Polly!
[en2]

What is this?
[en2]

This thing looks like a treadmill...
[nl2]Hmm...
[en2]

There's a small switch.
[en2]

What a rare plant! I must capture
[nl2]its mysterious beauty! Don't you
[nl3]feel like this is a plant paradise?
[en2]

Again~![np]
[nl2]Did Professor Marlowe get the
[nl3]photo?
[en2]

Did you find a rare plant?
[en2]

Documents are strewn about
[nl2]haphazardly.
[nl3]Did a burglar break in...?
[en2]

Well, would you get a look at this!
[nl2]It's research on that strange new
[nl3]plant...[np]
[scl]It seems it lives by sucking the
[scl]nutrients from other things...[np]
[scl]There's a lot of paperwork, so it
[scl]will take me some time to read
[scl]through all of it.
[en2]

Did you kids find something?
[nl2]I think I've almost worked through
[nl3]this research!
[en2]

Sorry to keep you waiting![np]
[nl2]I understand these documents now.
[en2]

I don't know why the parasite
[nl2]reacts to salt water, but I made
[nl3]this prototype for you to try out.
[en2]

So, how do you like my spray?
[en2]

If what that man said is true,
[nl2]we're dealing with some kind of
[nl3]ridiculously mean plant.
[en2]

Say~ what?
[nl2]The ghost was Benson?!
[nl3]Hahahahah...
[en2]

Water is flowing from here.
[en2]

Huh?
[nl2]It's a little salty!
[en2]

Awe~, what a great picture! If I'm
[nl2]ever feeling down, I can just look
[nl3]at this picture and smile!
[en1]

The door closed...
[en2]

This looks like the door switch.
[en2]

A... Bomb?!
[en2]

It looks like an exit...
[nl2]But... It's shut.
[en2]

[SMonkey1]Huff smuff![np]
[nl2]TL: I lost...
[en2]

It's impossible for you to look at
[nl2]your own X-Ray! Have someone
[nl3]stand in front for you!
[en2]

Ew, a bat.
[en2]

Ew, the bat is blocking my view!
[en2]

The one among you who likes
[nl2]building things is...
[en2]

You look raring to go!
[nl2]Next is {M}{a}{x}, the portly fellow!
[en1]

An adult is dressed up like a
[nl2]pirate~!
[en2]

Oh? Welcome home, dear.
[nl2]What's the hurry?!
[en2]

Lord Benson! 
[nl2]Tell them to become pirates!
[en2]

This plant is in the way.
[en2]

It's a plant, but it's moving...
[nl2]Look closely at the root there!
[nl3]DID YOU LOOK CLOSELY?!
[en2]

Oh, a sandbag!
[en2]

Oh my, Shocking![np]
[nl2]And lastly, {J}{a}{c}{k}, the beanpole!
[en1]

Hey, [team] Team.
[nl2]Have you ever looked underwater?
[nl3]It's amazing![np]
[scl]Since we've come all the way to
[scl]camp, we've gotta have fun~!!
[en2]

I'm a man, so I won't cry about it!
[nl2]If I find them again, I'll let you
[nl3]guys borrow them. Hahaha!
[en2]

The water is pretty deep here, so
[nl2]be careful!
[en2]

My heart is wide like the ocean!
[nl2]I'll let Max use my goggles.
[nl3]                   Hahahaha!
[en2]

You really saved our skins,
[nl2][team] Team.
[en2]

I'm hungry~[~]. Feed us~[~].
[nl2]Sing with me!
[en2]

Ahh, I'm pooped.
[en2]

Isn't lunch ready yet~?
[en2]

[nl2]    I'm hungry~ . Feed me~.
[en2]

Heheh, Dorothy was pretty mad at
[nl2]me earlier!
[en2]

Dorothy got super angry at me!!
[nl2]But really...
[en2]

Are you using those Soccer Shoes?
[en2]

I caught a fish with my bare
[nl2]hands earlier, so now my hands
[nl3]stink~.
[en2]

You guys are in the way of my
[nl2]special lunch preparations!
[en2]

Please prove Indio's innocence!
[en2]

No one has lived in this mysterious
[nl2]house for ages.
[nl3]Speaking of which...
[en2]

Where were you guys?!
[nl2]Miss Gina was looking for you!
[nl3]Did you run into her?
[en2]

[team] Team! You guys are late!
[nl2]You were off doing silly boy
[nl3]stuff, weren't you?
[en2]

Hey there, my friend.
[nl2]...What happened to the rest of
[nl3]your team?
[en2]

For now just c-c-calm down... 
[nl2]Or don't. Whatever.
[en2]

You are really going to save Miss
[nl2]Gina?

Hey, it's a monkey!

Huh? Got something to tell me?
[en2]

Hurray! The robot stopped moving!
[en2]

Oh, a big hole opened up!
[en2]

This flat thing.....
[nl2]            .....Must be Hassan.
[en2]

Just what are you lookin' at?!
[nl2]Come closer if you want to talk.
[en2]

What are you staring at?
[nl2]Want to try Papa Jam's "Kick and
[nl3]Smash!" game~?[np]
[scl]1 play for 1 {L}{u}{c}{k} {R}{o}{c}{k}.
[scl]You up for it?
[en2]

Hurry up and kick the ball!
[en2]

What is this machine? 
[nl2]Did that Jim look-alike build it?
[en2]

What is this machine? 
[nl2]...It looks like a goal.
[en2]

[nl2]...Not yet.
[en2]

A soccer ball.
[en2]

You've run out of {L}{u}{c}{k} {R}{o}{c}{k}{s}.
[nl2]I'll give one back to you.
[en2]

Run away! Quick!
[nl2]You can't defeat this {Q}{u}{e}{e}{n} with
[nl3]those items!
[en2]

Don't worry about me, look
[nl2]carefully at the {Q}{u}{e}{e}{n}!
[nl3]Her eyes are her weak points!
[en2]

Wh-what a giant ant!
[nl2]Our items won't make a dent!
[en2]

Thank you for saving us.
[en2]

Incredible. I've never seen such an
[nl2]glorious battle.
[nl3]I'm impressed...
[en2]

Anything's worth a try, I guess.
[nl2]The fact that there was another
[nl3]way...[np]
[scl]I can't believe you kids thought of that.
[en2]

Hurray!
[nl2]I didn't think it would go so well.
[en2]

This garden will get lonely...
[en2]

That Crystal Ball gave life to this
[nl2]garden but ALAS... 
[nl3]There is nothing to replace it.
[en2]

...Are you leaving so soon?
[nl2]Polly will be disappointed...
[en2]

Polly isn't in her room...
[nl2]I wonder where she went?
[en2]

What happened to Polly?[np]
[nl2]...Oh, she's safe? I'm so relieved.
[en2]

It's our picture!
[nl2]This was painted in blue... Red...
[nl3]And then green, I think.
[en2]

Welco..... Oh, the kids who invaded
[nl2]our kingdom. Are you supposed to
[nl3]be fuddling around here?
[en2]

What's wrong, children?
[nl2]If you're tired, feel free to rest
[nl3]in my inn.[np]

Look!! You boys were telling the

[en2]

...Something's moving.
[en2]

Ah! This is an eagle egg.
[en2]

Oh! Travelers, thank you!
[nl2]Princess Polly has safely returned
[nl3]to the castle.
[en2]

Oh! You made it back!
[nl2]...I could tell you weren't just any
[nl3]old kids.
[en2]

Thank you for saving the other
[nl2]soldiers. Everyone is praying for
[nl3]your safety.
[en2]

Did you have any trouble with the
[nl2]{B}{l}{u}{e} {A}{n}{t}{s}? How did you manage
[nl3]to defeat them?
[en2]

I heard you boys defeated the
[nl2]{Q}{u}{e}{e}{n}. I sincerely thank you.
[en2]

You kids are quite impressive.
[nl2]We adults were at a total loss,
[nl3]but you managed to save us.
[en2]

I heard. You guys are pretty
[nl2]good. Why don't you stay here and
[nl3]join the army?
[en2]

Did you already see the king?
[nl2]I'm sure he'll have a special
[nl3]reward for you.
[en2]

Thank you, [team] Team.
[nl2]         .....What?.....[np]
[nl3]You want to know how I know your
[scl]name?
[en2]

I lost the "Soldier Blue" inside the
[nl2]"Blue Things'" nest.
[nl3]Remember me?
[en2]

Very impressive, boys.
[nl2]I hope my children grow up to be
[nl3]like you all.
[en2]

Stouthearted children: As long as
[nl2]I live, I will never forget what
[nl3][team] Team did for my soldiers.
[en2]

Thank you for saving me in the
[nl2]nest of the {B}{l}{u}{e} {T}{h}{i}{n}{g}{s}.
[nl3]You were like angels.

Thank you for saving me in the

Thank you, [team] Team.
[nl2]If it weren't for you, I wouldn't
[nl3]be standing here right now.

Good job coming back in one piece. [np]
[nl2]I shudder to think what would've
[nl3]happened to me if you hadn't been
[scl]there, [team] Team.....
[en2]

Hurray![np]
[nl2]I'm shocked that you boys
[nl3]managed to defeat the queen all

Thank you, travelers.
[nl2]We're terribly sorry for treating
[nl3]you like criminals.[np]
[scl]In the confusion, we may have
[scl]overreacted.

Oh! You're back!
[nl2]How was the {B}{u}{s}{t}{e}{r} {C}{a}{n}{n}{o}{n}?
[nl3]I knew you kids could handle it!

Oooh, the king's private garden...
[nl2]I had no idea...[np]
[nl3]...Well... It's...
[scl]A nice garden, I guess.
[en2]

...Huh?
[nl2]What is this giant ball...?
[en2]

It's what?... What's wrong with the
[nl2]Crystal Ball?
[en2]

What are you saying?! ...Hmmm...!!!              
[nl2]         That's--!![np]
[nl3]You're saying that everything
[scl]outside the castle seems huge...
[scl]Because WE shrunk?!?
[en2]

I heard what you said.
[nl2]Go on and take this "reward."
[en2]

What will you do?
[nl2]The Crystal Ball... is too large to
[nl3]fit through the entrance.
[en2]

The king is sort of lazy. He tends
[nl2]to always delegate his duties to
[nl3]others...[np]
[scl]Ah-- but don't let him know I told
[scl]you.
[en2]

How can you move this giant ball?
[en2]

I wonder if we can combine our
[nl2]power to lift this ball...?
[en2]

Did you learn the eagle egg's
[nl2]pattern?
[en2]

I wonder if Solomon's idea will
[nl2]actually work? Will the eagle
[nl3]really carry it off...?
[en2]

So you have to paint an egg
[nl2]pattern onto this ball...
[en2]

What are you waiting for?
[nl2]Hurry up and find an egg.
[en2]

Oh, the heroes are back.
[nl2]Sounds like you put on quite a
