Many years ago...
Pirates secretly reigned
over the seven seas.
They would do anything for
gold, silver, or jewels.
Yet among the many ruffians
was one particular pirate
— Captain Maverick —
whose vast knowledge
and exceptional skills
found him lasting fame.

With the rise of the airplane
and the power of justice,
pirates began to fade into history.
He decided to hide his treasure
upon a certain island,
announcing to the papers thus:
"If you seek my treasure,
 Just try and solve my riddles!"
Ever since,
adventurers seeking wealth
have tried to discover it,
yet none have proved successful.

This mysterious treasure
— the "Marvelous" —
even now still lies in wait
for the right adventurer.
