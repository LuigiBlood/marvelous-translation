used for all numbered blue keys



















Soldier ONE\Rhymes with "FUN"\original hint told you the number sounds like the noise a dog makes, but in english (WAN)
Used for all numbered red keys
Soldier TWO







used for all numbered green keys

Soldier THREE\This translates!!!











original script calls them cheeky, but it's not really a word most americans use or are familiar with. Could say impudent, but I like the thought of king bull calling them stinky.


Soldier FOUR
Soldier FIVE
Soldier SIX\Original Japanese tells the reader that the number sounds like the english word "Socks"

Soldier SEVEN\Essentially translates correctly. The hint originally said the number sounds like the english word for heaven.

Soldier EIGHT
Soldier NINE
Soldier TEN\The japanese text refers to the sound made by a sizzling steak. This makes the speaker realize he hasn't had steak recently.
Soldier ELEVEN
Soldier TWELVE\Easy answer, but the original clue really doesnt translate well to english.
Soldier THIRTEEN\Talking about friday the 13th.

took some liberties here. it's supposed to be funny... "darn" means to mend -- if you do needlepoint with yarn, you'd use a darning needle. its funny to me, okay?
