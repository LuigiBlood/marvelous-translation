This is miss Sisko speaking. Old translation:\I believe children are able to\[nl2]sense virtue in people.[np]\[nl3]So it was my dream to become a\[scl]teacher--[np]\[scl]In order to teach children to have\[scl]kind hearts.
Don't worry, I haven't changed at\[nl2]all... Look, aren't I pretty?










わがまま is a whimsical way to say she's a bit spoiled, a tad selfish.\I chose bossy due to the context of what she said previously
Made some adjustments to the tone to better match the original. The original text is actually praising jim, calling his actions "truly logical".

fixing this up a bit to be more accurate to the original
it didnt say crystal ball, but meh. less wordy is nice sometimes
specific reference to the platform was missing
Literally, Polly says:\"If I stay here, another big dog might come along... As a thank you, I'll go with you. Let's see... The chubbiest one will do."\I've embellished it a bit and added the concern about being eaten, and tried to make it more humorous referring to the chubbiest one as a burly butterball.
Literally: Ugh! Are you trying to make a lady feel embarrassed? Come closer, or I can't go with you!\I've embellished a bit, adding a reference to the dog while trying to enhance the comedic tone and in keeping her bossy persona.
essentially restored the literal translation because It fits better

used for all numbered blue keys



















Soldier ONE\Rhymes with "FUN"\original hint told you the number sounds like the noise a dog makes, but in english (WAN)
Used for all numbered red keys
Soldier TWO







used for all numbered green keys

Soldier THREE\This translates!!!











original script calls them cheeky, but it's not really a word most americans use or are familiar with. Could say impudent, but I like the thought of king bull calling them stinky.


Soldier FOUR
Soldier FIVE
Soldier SIX\Original Japanese tells the reader that the number sounds like the english word "Socks"

Soldier SEVEN\Essentially translates correctly. The hint originally said the number sounds like the english word for heaven.

Soldier EIGHT
Soldier NINE
Soldier TEN\The japanese text refers to the sound made by a sizzling steak. This makes the speaker realize he hasn't had steak recently.
Soldier ELEVEN
Soldier TWELVE\Easy answer, but the original clue really doesnt translate well to english.
Soldier THIRTEEN\Talking about friday the 13th.
