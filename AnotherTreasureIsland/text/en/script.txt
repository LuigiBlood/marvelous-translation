[nl2]    What's this?!
[en2]

[nl2]We have to get closer!
[en2]

Message failure.
[en2]

...Huh? 
[nl2]How can we hear 
[nl3]Miss Gina's voice...[np]
[scl]There are two of her??
[scl]...What in the...?

Did you get the item

[nl2]TL: Here we are, home
[nl3]sweet camp.[np]
[scl]Are you ready?
[en1]

Muuuha! Hayaah!
[nl2]Don't distract me, it'll
[nl3]get away![np]
[scl]Guraaah, this is the
[scl]big one!!
[en2]

Chirpy-chirp.[np]
[nl2]TL: I'm gonna go ahead
[nl3]and wait for you.[np]
[scl]Winky, let's go!
[en1]

Leave the rest to us.
[nl2]Why don't you guys
[nl3]explore the island?
[en2]

Why don't you explore
[nl2]the island until lunch
[nl3]is ready?[np]
[scl]You might make a new
[scl]discovery.
[en2]

Huh?! You don't have
[nl2]enough Luck Rocks![np]
[nl3]Come back when you
[scl]have a lot more.
[en1]

Our leader is a
[nl2]fishing freak,[np]
[nl3]but he has never 
[scl]caught a fish before.[np]
[scl]He only pulls up junk.
[en2]

What if we left one
[nl2]strong guy below?[np]
[nl3]Perhaps the other two 
[scl]can try to lift from
[scl]above?

Hurry and grab it!!

Ooo-kii! Ooo-kii![np]
[nl2]TL: Save me! Save me!
[en2]

Where does this go?
[en2]

It seems that if we
[nl2]push the lever, we can
[nl3]make it rotate.[np]
[scl]But it's too heavy for
[scl]one person.
[en2]

Can't we move it
[nl2]somehow...?
[en2]

The powerful water
[nl2]flow moved the
[nl3]boulder!
[en2]

Ooo-kiii![np]
[nl2]TL:...Wait!
[en1]

It says:
[nl2]"Danger!
[nl3] Pitfall ahead."
[en2]

Ready!
[nl2]This will trip them up
[nl3]for sure. Heheh...
[en2]

[nl2]  More junk? Shucks.
[en2]

How can we lift such a
[nl2]large object...?
[en2]

If we lift from both
[nl2]sides of the boulder,
[nl3]maybe we can move it.
[en2]

You wanna piece of me?[np]
[nl2]Best watch yourself
[nl3]before your pretty
[scl]little face gets[np]
[scl]smashed up like mine![np]

[scl]We called the police,

[scl]for Miss Gina.[np]
[scl]You should probably
[scl]get a ride from them
[scl]to town, too.[np]
[scl]This year's camp
[scl]really got out of

Alright, [team] Team,

[scl]Also, there are lots

[scl]They're called

[scl]You guys put the other

[scl]Do it together, okay?
[en2]

I am a gentle 
[nl2]watering robot.[np]
[nl3]I water dried out 
[scl]plants. But...[np]
[scl]Without a remote, I'm
[scl]just a robot.
[en2]

Let's move a bit
[nl2]closer for a look.

There are pots below.[np]
[nl2]Three of them appear 
[nl3]to be in this hole...[np]
[scl]Looks like two red
[scl]pots and one blue pot.
[en2]

You saved a monkey,
[nl2]but bullied a dog.[np]
[nl3]Monkeys and dogs have
[scl]been rivals since
[scl]ancient times...[np]
[scl]However, I am a friend
[scl]to dogs, so I'll fight
[scl]you!
[en2]

Even if it doesn't
[nl2]work, we've come so
[nl3]far. Let's just do it!
[en2]

Ooo ooo aah...[np]
[nl2]TL: Thank you, nice
[nl3]boys.[np]
[scl]I'll give you what they
[scl]were after.
[en1]

[F2]You receive some kind
[nl2]of weird keys from the

[scl]Their colors match our
[scl]clothing, strangely
[scl]enough.[np]
[scl]What do these keys
[scl]open??
[en1]

I don't see any fish
[nl2]around here...
[en2]

Maybe we could tie
[nl2]them together with
[nl3]a rope.
[en2]

Chirpee-chirple.[np]
[nl2]TL: On the count of 3,
[nl3]press [ABtn], okay?
[en1]

Let's get a running
[nl2]start and then BANG,[np]
[nl3]SMASH we can break
[scl]down the door!
[en2]

[F2]You made a ladder!
[en1]

I think there's a
[nl2]keyhole.[np]
[nl3]Let's get closer.
[en2]

How 'bout we take a
[nl2]closer look.
[en2]

[nl2] Woooooooooosh~!
[en2]

Something's wrong.
[nl2]All of us need to line
[nl3]up behind the box.
[en1]

I didn't think so
[nl2]before...[np]
[nl3]But maybe Miss Gina is
[scl]this way?...
[en2]

It looks like we can
[nl2]ride in it, but it
[nl3]only fits one person.
[en2]

It's fast! I guess we
[nl2]can't avoid them if
[nl3]we're together.
[en2]

But how can we get
[nl2]there...?
[en2]

Take a Look, sheriff!
[nl2]Have a piece of this!
[en1]

If we pull it like
[nl2]this, we won't be able
[nl3]to get back out.
[en2]

What? The sheriff was
[nl2]a plant?![np]
[nl3]But I'm the sheriff.[np]
[scl]Oh, he transformed
[scl]INTO the villagers 
[scl]and attacked them!
[en2]

Ooo-kii-kii, kiiiii![np]
[nl2]TL: Come here!
[nl3]Hurry! Hurry!
[en2]

I believe children are
[nl2]able to sense virtue
[nl3]in people.[np]
[scl]So it was my dream to
[scl]become a teacher--[np]
[scl]In order to teach
[scl]children to have kind
[scl]hearts.
[en2]

Don't worry, I haven't
[nl2]changed at all. Look,

[en2]

We can ride on top of
[nl2]it!
[en2]

[SMonkey1]Ooo-kii!! Come back
[nl2]soon, okay?...
[en2]

How does this open...?
[en2]

Juuust kidding![np]

[scl]Start when you're
[scl]ready.
[en1]

Something's not right.
[nl2]We'll need to position
[nl3]ourselves around the[np]
[scl]lever evenly or we
[scl]can't move it.
[en2]

Something's wrong.[np]
[nl2]All three of us need
[nl3]to line up in front
[scl]of the pipe.
[en2]

Hey there, tubs.
[nl2]I like husky kids.[np]
[nl3]This will probably be
[scl]a long journey, so
[scl]let's be friends.
[en1]

[X$6A]It's a girl the size of
[nl2]my thumb.
[en2]

[F2]Polly, the tiny girl, 
[nl2]became your friend?![np]
[nl3]She can help us in
[scl]places that are too
[scl]small for us.[np]
[scl]She seems a little
[scl]bossy...
[en1]

Dear [team] Team,
[nl2]How are your studies?[np]
[nl3]It seems Jim misjudged
[scl]you after all.[np]
[scl]His behavior after
[scl]Miss Gina's abduction
[scl]was presumptuous.[np]
[scl]Despite that, it 
[scl]would be for the best
[scl]if you were to return.[np]
[scl]You should either wait 
[scl]for the police,[np] 
[scl]or find a ship and 
[scl]leave that island.[np]
[scl]I wish you luck.
[scl]      ~Keep studying.

[nl3]and get out of here![np]
[scl]Hurry!
[en1]

Chirpoo? Chirp.[np]
[nl2]TL: What's wrong?
[nl3]That will never work.[np]
[scl]The three of you need
[scl]to line up more
[scl]closely to it.
[en2]

If I stay here,
[nl2]another dog might try
[nl3]to eat me...[np]
[scl]...So my present to
[scl]you is to go along
[scl]with you.[np]
[scl]I'll hitch a ride with
[scl]fatty here.
[en1]

What are you thinking
[nl2]of doing to a lady!?[np]
[nl3]If you don't come

[nl3]are in this room, we
[scl]can't stop the ship.[np]
[scl]Bring everyone here.
[en2]

I wonder if something
[nl2]is at the base of the
[nl3]tree...
[en1]

There are tiny
[nl2]footprints leading to
[nl3]the tree trunk.
[en1]

There's nothing here
[nl2]anymore!
[en2]

Where does this go...?
[en2]

[X$6A]Alright, let's combine
[nl2]our power!

What is it?
[nl2]I don't know anything.

It was all in good

...Hmmn? You want to

[nl3]If you write it in

[nl3]My number is the same

...Eh? You wanna know

[nl3]Okay...
[scl]So...

[scl]If you flip my number

[nl2]A man doesn't go back

[scl]Here, take your [X$6B][LuckRock].

Bow wow woof![np]
[nl2]TL: Give twice as much

[scl]That's how dogs roll.

These logs are tied

[nl3]I don't think they can

[en2]

How dare you just
[nl2]barge in here without
[nl3]an appointment![np]
[scl]I'm a very busy man.
[scl]Come back later...
[en2]

Oh, you want to go
[nl2]deeper into the
[nl3]jungle?[np]
[scl]Well, I don't trust
[scl]you! This town is full
[scl]of delinquents...[np]
[scl]Earlier, a brat named
[scl]John stole the key![np]
[scl]If you want to unlock the
[scl]gate that badly,[np]
[scl]find John and get the
[scl]key from him.
[en2]

Huh... What's this?[np]
[nl2]Oh... the board is
[nl3]broken so we can't
[scl]read the phone number.
[en2]

Huh?... What's this?[np]
[nl2]"DO NOT ENTER!"
[nl3]Direct inquiries to

[scl]So that's how it is!

[SMonkey1]Ooki! Ookii![np]
[nl2]TL: Dang it! Did you
[nl3]think we'd run off
[scl]after we lost?[np]
[scl]
[scl]Well, you're right!

What on earth is in
[nl2]this?
[nl3]It's awfully heavy.
[en2]

If there's nothing
[nl2]behind it, the machine
[nl3]won't work?!
[en2]

Is Deon really a

They even show up on

[nl3]What are Jack's

Max is...

I see, I see. You kids

[nl3]with some research.[np]
[scl]Alright, lead the way!
[scl]...Aren't I a nice
[scl]guy?
[en1]

You're too fast!
[nl2]Show your elders some
[nl3]respect!
[en2]

[X$6A]He seems like
[nl2]he's guarding this

[en2]

It looks like there
[nl2]used to be a hole
[nl3]here...
[en2]

We sell the Baobab
[nl2]tree's oil in this
[nl3]village.[np]
[scl]Mr. Smith was the one
[scl]who discovered it.[np]
[scl]If you want to know
[scl]more,[np]
[scl]you should head East
[scl]to his house and ask
[scl]him personally.
[en2]

My baby is sleeping,
[nl2]don't you dare wake
[nl3]him up...
[en2]

Oh no, I'm sorry![np]
[nl2]Thanks to Mr. Smith,
[nl3]the villagers can make
[scl]a living selling oil,[np]
[scl]but lately, thieves
[scl]have been coming to
[scl]steal the tree oil.[np]
[scl]By the way, I'm
[scl]one of them.
[en1]

John's just inside,
[nl2]follow me!
[en2]

Huh!? You can see
[nl2]through the keyhole!
[en2]

Polly: Hey, small and
[nl2]tall![np]
[nl3]    Just what are you
[scl]    trying to force a
[scl]    lil' lady to do!?[np]
[scl]    Right, darling?
[en2]

Hehehe... Who is John?
[nl2]Don't look at me.
[nl3]John is over there!
[en2]

[SAwe]Wash off your shame
[nl2]and try again!
[en1]

Just kidding~!
[nl2]I AM John!
[nl3]Nuts, you found me.[np]
[scl]Fine, I'll give it
[scl]back. Let's play again
[scl]sometime!
[en1]

[F2]Received the Gate
[nl2]Key from John![np]
[nl3]...But you get a lot
[scl]of keys, so it's not
[scl]that special anymore.
[en1]

But really...
[nl2]I just want to try a
[nl3]grown-up game.
[en2]

There are various
[nl2]numbers.
[nl3]What could they be?
[en2]

...Should you try
[nl2]standing there?
[en2]

It looks like it might
[nl2]start moving... gross!
[en2]

Was this part of some
[nl2]experiment...?
[en2]

The ground is still
[nl2]wet here... [np]
[nl3]It must have broken
[scl]out recently.
[en2]

It's hard to see
[nl2]without getting
[nl3]closer.
[en2]

What happened to your
[nl2]friends?[np]
[nl3]Unless all 3 of you
[scl]are here, the ship
[scl]can't depart.
[en1]

[F2]We got the phone
[nl2]number for the
[nl3]management office![np]
[scl]Just as I suspected!
[en1]

The guy with the key
[nl2]is... John...!?
[en1]

Uhh...Which one is
[nl2]John!?
[en1]

It says...
[nl2] 1.Latin   3.Rock
[nl3] 2.Jazz    4.J-Pop
[en2]

Hmm~!

Hmm~!
[nl2]Feelin' Jazzy!
[en2]

Hmm~!
[nl2]I feel like rockin'!
[en2]

Hmm~!...
[nl2]J-Pop... Umm...
[nl3]M...maybe some J-Pop?!

Okay, the engine

[F2]Now we can go deeper
[nl2]into the island![np]
[nl3]...It's so exciting!
[en1]

I'm a thief who steals
[nl2]women's hearts, a
[nl3]heart thief!

Hey Hassan, Solomon.
[nl2]Long time no see.[np]
[nl3]It's me, Polly!
[scl]Step back, I'll

Ooooh! Princess!![np]
[nl2]It's been 3 months
[nl3]since you left on your

I won't be done in so
[nl2]easily!![np]

[scl]Alright, good luck,

Hey, only the guy with

[nl3]in the ring.
[en2]

[SStop]Alright, I'll take you
[nl2]straight to heaven!
[en1]

I'm sorry!
[nl2]We used boxing to make
[nl3]a living...[np]
[scl]From now on, we'll
[scl]work hard to be better
[scl]parents for our twins.
[en2]

John and Ken are
[nl2]musical boys, so if
[nl3]they hear some hard[np]
[scl]beats, they'll start
[scl]dancing.
[en2]

[nl2]      You guys!!
[en2]

Haha, you found me
[nl2]out.[np]
[nl3]I can't compare to
[scl]real twins, I guess.
[en1]

Haha, you found out I
[nl2]wasn't sleeping.[np]
[nl3]I want to be a
[scl]grown-up so I can stay
[scl]up late!
[en2]

I don't play with
[nl2]dolls anymore!...
[nl3]Cuz I'm a boy!
[en2]

What was that? I can't
[nl2]hear you over the
[nl3]crying baby.[np]
[scl]Come closer...
[en2]

[X$6A]Oh, she stopped
[nl2]crying![np]
[nl3][X$6A]Thank you! She stopped
[scl]crying when she saw
[scl]her doll~.[np]
[scl]Now you have seen all
[scl][Three] females.
[scl][np]
[scl]You kids want to know
[scl]more about the
[scl]townspeople?[np]
[scl]You should ask my
[scl]husband! Oh, but you
[scl]don't know who he is.[np]
[scl]You can recognize him
[scl]because he loves my
[scl]cooking...[np]
[scl]He loves my cooking
[scl]more than anything
[scl]else on Earth![np]
[scl]Here, take this.
[en1]

[F2]You got a Chili Lunch![np]
[nl2]...It looks spicy~!
[en1]

This child won't stop
[nl2]crying and it's
[nl3]driving me nuts![np]
[scl]Please do something!
[en2]

My husband loves my
[nl2]cooking more than
[nl3]anything on Earth.[np]
[scl]If you give him this
[scl]lunch I made, you can
[scl]find him right away.
[en2]

I went to the basement
[nl2]under this house to
[nl3]get to the cave,[np]
[scl]but the gate was
[scl]locked![np]
[scl]I'm pretty sure Mr.
[scl]Smith has the key
[scl]locked up in a safe...[np]
[scl]If you want to enter
[scl]the cave, you need to
[scl]find Mr. Smith.[np]
[scl]Otherwise, just give
[scl]up![np]
[scl]If you find him, come
[scl]tell me right away.[np]
[scl]I'll give you
[scl]something for your
[scl]trouble.
[en2]

It's too far to tell
[nl2]what it is.
[en2]

[nl2]   I'm digging in!
[nl3][np]
[scl]Nom-nom-nommmmm-nooom!
[scl]Smmmmuuu~~ff!![np]
[scl]OH MAN! I love my
[scl]darling's cooking.[np]
[scl]Her cooking is the
[scl]best in the world![np]
[scl]By the way, did you
[scl]find a key yet?
[scl][np]
[scl][SImprtnt]What's up? A plant
[scl]that can turn into
[scl]people?[np]
[scl]Who is it turning
[scl]into?![np]
[scl]If that's true, that's
[scl]a fine pickle...[np]
[scl]I used to have a
[scl]weapon for defeating
[scl]bad guys,[np]
[scl]but now all I have is
[scl]this.[np]
[scl]Still... It's better
[scl]than nothing, so I'll
[scl]give it to you.
[en1]

[F2]Received an Empty
[nl2]Water Bottle![np]
[nl3]This isn't a weapon
[scl]at all~![np]
[scl]It's really walking
[scl]the line of "better
[scl]than nothing."
[en1]

All 3 are the same
[nl2]switch.
[en2]

I won't tell outsiders
[nl2]anything about this
[nl3]town.
[en2]

It's too far to see
[nl2]what it is!
[en2]

Ohh, that looks
[nl2]delicious! What?
[nl3]You'll give it to me?[np]
[scl]Thanks! Mmmm...
[en1]

W-Water!!... Water!!
[nl2]Quick... Bring me
[nl3]water!!!
[en2]

Glug glug glug...
[en1]

Okay, there are
[nl2]probably more of them,
[nl3]right?[np]
[scl]Listen closely to
[scl]what I'm about to tell
[scl]you.
[en2]

Why is it in here?
[en2]

It's locked and won't
[nl2]open.
[en2]

[F2]The gate opened![np]
[nl2]Now we can go into the
[nl3]cave!
[en1]

P...please forgive me!
[nl2]I'm not really from
[nl3]this island.[np]
[scl]I'm just a thief who
[scl]heard there was a
[scl]mysterious treasure[np]
[scl]on the island so I
[scl]came to steal it.[np]
[scl]I stole the key, but
[scl]in that room...[np]
[scl]There was some kind of
[scl]plant, and it...[np]
[scl]It turned into me..!
[scl]It was so scary!
[en1]

Thank you!
[nl2]You saved me![np]
[nl3]I'm in charge of this
[scl]village.
[scl]Call me Smith.[np]
[scl]I was studying the
[scl]parasite that attached
[scl]to the Baobab tree,[np]
[scl]and then it suddenly
[scl]turned into me...[np]
[scl]And then it attacked
[scl]me![np]
[scl]Oh! I have to destroy
[scl]the rest of the
[scl]parasite before it[np]
[scl]escapes and causes
[scl]more trouble!!
[en1]

No one from the
[nl2]village would come
[nl3]into this room.[np]
[scl]A thief must have come
[scl]in here and gotten
[scl]attacked by a plant!
[en1]

Please don't say that![np]
[nl2]Unless you do
[nl3]something, that
[scl]crystal ball will...[np]
[scl]Please, listen to me!
[scl]
[scl]
[en1]

You'll help me?!
[nl2]If you investigate all
[nl3]the villagers,[np]
[scl]I'm sure you can find
[scl]the criminal![np]
[scl]First, go find a man
[scl]named Mike.[np]
[scl]He knows how many
[scl]people live in the
[scl]village.[np]
[scl]Mike[SImprtnt] gets scared at
[scl]the squeak of a mouse,[np]
[scl]so you'll probably
[scl]find the fraidy-cat at
[scl]his house.
[en2]

If you want to find
[nl2]out how many people
[nl3]live in the village,[np]
[scl]you should ask Mike.[np]
[scl]He's a coward who
[scl]can't bear to hear a
[scl]mouse's squeak,[np]
[scl]so he never leaves his
[scl]home.
[en2]

You want to know how
[nl2]many villagers there
[nl3]are?[np]
[scl]I'll only tell that
[scl]large boy in the
[scl]green...
[en2]

By the way... Don't
[nl2]say anything about my
[nl3]fear of mice, okay?[np]
[scl]You can have this.
[en1]

[F2]You received a Village
[nl2]Coin![np]
[nl3]Is his secret that big
[scl]of a deal?[np]
[scl][X$6A]If you lose that
[scl]coin, come back
[scl]anytime.[np]
[scl]But watch out for
[scl]Jackie, he'll take
[scl]your money!
[en1]

What? Another one?[np]
[nl2]Fine, but keep quiet
[nl3]about that other
[scl]thing, okay?
[en1]

I'll give you a coin
[nl2]whenever you need it,[np]
[nl3]but don't let anyone
[scl]know my secret.
[en2]

There's a small hole.
[en2]

It looks like a mouse
[nl2]hole!
[en2]

You need to get
[nl2]closer!
[en2]

Come on out, Mousey!
[nl2]Got some yummy cheeese
[nl3]for you~!
[en1]

Squeak squeak...[np]
[nl2]TL: Meh, I've had
[nl3]better...
[en2]

...What?
[nl2]I can't hear if you're
[nl3]over there!
[en2]

I can't do my job like
[nl2]this, man![np]
[nl3]Can you kids go inside
[scl]and persuade Mr. Smith
[scl]to let me back in?[X$6A][np]
[scl]    Fine.
[scl]    I don't wanna.[X$68]
[en1]

Thanks a ton! Come see
[nl2]me later and I'll give
[nl3]you a reward.[np]
[scl]Oh, I think there's a
[scl]lot of Luck Rocks in
[scl]the tree west of here.[np]
[scl]Okay, see you guys
[scl]later!
[en1]

Don't be like that![np]
[nl2]There's just a cute
[nl3]little dog inside, so
[scl]don't worry.[np]
[scl]I'm heading back to
[scl]the village now,[np]
[scl]but if you stop by
[scl]later, I'll give you a
[scl]reward![np]
[scl]
[scl] It's something nice!
[scl]
[en1]

[F2]You got the old,
[nl2]Holey Cheese![np]
[nl3]Only Max or a mouse
[scl]would consider this a
[scl]reward...
[en1]

If you don't have
[nl2]anything to say, then
[nl3]get out of here!
[en2]

He... He disappeared?!
[en2]

This dog...
[nl2]Seems kind of weird?!
[en2]

It's... It's moving!
[en2]

The inside of the
[nl2]collar says "Socks."[np]
[nl3]This must have been
[scl]the real Socks.[np]
[scl]Then what was that
[scl]other dog we saw...?
[en2]

It's no good!
[nl2]The line's busy...
[en2]

Hey, the ring is over
[nl2]there.
[en2]

Suddenly, the ship
[nl2]veers alongside!!!
[en2]

Phew, that was
[nl2]close...
[nl3][SImprtnt]Eeh?
[en1]

...Why have you come
[nl2]here?!
[en2]

Thanks to you guys I'm
[nl2]the laughing stock
[nl3]of the kingdom![np]
[scl]I'll never forgive
[scl]you!
[en2]

You have incurred the
[nl2]king's wrath.[np]
[nl3]Come with me to
[scl]fulfill your
[scl]punishment.
[en1]

I'm glad the princess
[nl2]came back,[np]
[nl3]but things have been
[scl]getting stranger and
[scl]stranger.[np]
[scl]Solomon seems a little
[scl]blue...
[en2]

Did you already talk
[nl2]to Solomon?
[nl3]He talks like a sissy,[np]
[scl]but he's one of the
[scl]best warriors in the
[scl]kingdom.
[en2]

There are all sorts of
[nl2]mysterious animals
[nl3]deep under the ground.[np]
[scl]Perhaps you criminals
[scl]will become a snack
[scl]for them...[np]
[scl]Such a pity.
[en2]

First that tomboy
[nl2]caused a ruckus by
[nl3]runnin' away from home[np]
[scl]and then she comes
[scl]strolling back in with
[scl]three criminals.[np]
[scl]Princess Polly is
[scl]quite a handful...
[en2]

I bet you were
[nl2]surprised when you saw
[nl3]the king, weren't you?[np]
[scl]This kingdom has
[scl]always been very hot.[np]
[scl]Why doesn't he take
[scl]off that heavy gown?
[en2]

Besides the "Blue
[nl2]Things" there are many
[nl3]gigantic bugs,[np]
[scl]but only the ants have
[scl]formed an army and
[scl]attacked our kingdom.
[en2]

Even if the ants want
[nl2]to attack, they can't-[np]
[nl3]thanks to the miracle
[scl]remedy, Ant Buster![np]
[scl]If I can complete it's
[scl]production, the Ant
[scl]Menace will be abated.[np]
[scl]
[scl]Which means, as your
[scl]punishment...[np]
[scl]You must search the
[scl]dangerous forest for
[scl]the ingredients.[np]
[scl]The princess says that
[scl]the three of you are
[scl]capable adventurers,[np]
[scl]able to handle any
[scl]challenge, so I'm
[scl]hoping for the best.[np]
[scl]Not only is this your
[scl]punishment, it is a
[scl]personal plea from me.[np]
[scl]I'm sure if you manage
[scl]to succeed,[np]
[scl]the king will reassess
[scl]your sentence.[np]
[scl]  Will you help me?[X$6A]
[scl]    Okay
[scl]    No way![X$68]
[en1]

I'm begging you.
[nl2]If you can help me
[nl3]make the Ant Buster,[np]
[scl]I'm sure the king will
[scl]forgive you.[np]
[scl]  Okay, or no way?[X$6A]
[scl]    Okay.
[scl]    No way![X$68]
[en1]

I'm terribly sorry to
[nl2]hear that.[np]
[nl3]In accordance to law,
[scl]you will be fed to the
[scl]ants.
[scl]...I really hate to do
[scl]it, but...
[scl]
[en1]

Well, aren't you brave
[nl2]little boys![np]
[nl3]Well then, I can't let
[scl]all three of you leave
[scl]together,[np]
[scl]but you can open the
[scl]gate on the right
[scl]there.
[en1]

The one who stays
[nl2]behind must stand in
[nl3]the middle of the cell[np]
[scl]on the lit-up block.
[scl]That will open and
[scl]close the gate.
[en2]

There are 5 things you
[nl2]need to get. Read the
[nl3]blackboard for detail.[np]
[scl]Make sure you remember
[scl]them properly.
[en2]

This small kingdom
[nl2]would be completely
[nl3]overwhelmed,[np]
[scl]if the ants attacked
[scl]tomorrow...
[en2]

Listen carefully to
[nl2]Hassan's sentence and
[nl3]repent your sins!
[en2]

If I don't get home
[nl2]soon, my mom will find
[nl3]out I'm not in bed,[np]
[scl]so later, dudes!!

[nl2]Press [BBtn] to punch your
[nl3]problems in the face!
[en1]

I have something for
[nl2]you, so get over here!
[en2]

Sorry for what I said
[nl2]earlier.[np]
[nl3]It's just a leftover
[scl]from lunch, but take
[scl]this snack!
[en1]

If you don't have a
[nl2]key, just give up.
[en2]

It's going all the way
[nl2]to the top.
[en2]

Heeeeyyyy~~!
[nl2]Is any~~~one there~~?![np]
[nl3]If you grab, the
[scl]rooope~, we'll pu~ull
[scl]yooou up~~~![np]
[scl]Yoo~u nee~ed heeelp~?
[scl]    Yes, pleeease~!
[scl]    Nooo~, thanks~~![X$68]
[en1]

We sprayed Ant Buster
[nl2]on the rope and all
[nl3]around the hole,[np]
[scl]but I still don't feel
[scl]very safe.
[en2]

Is the princess safe?
[nl2]She couldn't already
[nl3]be...
[en2]

Even though all those
[nl2]soldiers went down,[np]
[nl3]only one made it back
[scl]alive.[np]
[scl]The Ant Buster alone
[scl]isn't enough to win
[scl]this fight.
[en2]

You cant's see it
[nl2]anymore. It's fallen
[nl3]to the bottom.
[en2]

We finished the King's
[nl2]gown.[np]
[nl3]Maybe Polly's father
[scl]will change his mind
[scl]about us now.
[en2]

It goes allll the way
[nl2]to the top.
[en1]

The King's birthday is
[nl2]coming up in only 3
[nl3]day's time![np]
[scl]I need to finish his
[scl]portrait in time for
[scl]his birthday, or else![np]
[scl]But, woe is me, I was
[scl]out on a stroll when
[scl]all of the sudden,[np]
[scl]a gang of spiders from
[scl]the forest mugged me
[scl]and stole my paints![np]
[scl]Oh, what will I do
[scl]now~?
[en2]

What are you doing?
[nl2]If you do anything
[nl3]suspicious,[np]
[scl]the soldiers will
[scl]arrest you again.
[en2]

The gown isn't
[nl2]finished yet.
[en2]

Wowzers! Those are the
[nl2]painting tools Caesar
[nl3]lost in the forest![np]
[scl]Go take them to Caesar
[scl]right away.
[en2]

Those are the paints I
[nl2]lost in the forest...[np]
[nl3]Thank you for finding
[scl]them for me...
[scl][np]
[scl]But, I'm gonna let you
[scl]go ahead and keep
[scl]them.[np]
[scl]According to my
[scl]calculations,[np]
[scl]overlapping two of
[scl]those paints will
[scl]finish this painting.[np]
[scl]The problem lies in
[scl]which order to use the
[scl]paints.[np]
[scl]My painting know-how
[scl]is in a book in the
[scl]castle archives.[np]
[scl]If you try to remember
[scl]what the king's gown
[scl]looks like,[np]
[scl]you could read the[np]
[scl]book and figure out
[scl]how to duplicate it...
[en2]

You can't paint like
[nl2]that.[np]
[nl3]You have to focus and
[scl]use all 3 at once.
[en2]

Unless you have all 3
[nl2]paints, we can't
[nl3]finish the painting.
[en2]

[SStop]Who's gonna paint now?[np]
[nl2]Think of the king's
[nl3]gown and pick the
[scl]first color.[np]
[scl]    Deon - Red
[scl]    Jack - Blue
[scl]    Max  - Green[X$6E]
[en1]

Who's goes next?
[nl2]    Deon - Red
[nl3]    Jack - Blue[X$68]
[en1]

And then who?
[nl2]    Deon - Red
[nl3]    Max  - Green[X$68]
[en1]

Who's gonna go next?
[nl2]    Jack - Blue
[nl3]    Max  - Green[X$68]
[en1]

Close, but the design
[nl2]is wrong.[np]
[nl3]Go clear your head and
[scl]try again later.
[scl]
[en1]

It's... pitch black!!
[nl2]Didn't you read my
[nl3]painting book?[np]
[scl]Go take a breather and
[scl]try again later.
[scl]
[en1]

Don't forget to paint
[nl2]two layers.
[en2]

Stop it right there![np]
[nl2]Even if you paint on
[nl3]top of that, there's
[scl]no way to fix it![np]
[scl]Leave and come back
[scl]later.
[scl]
[en2]

[F2]It's beautiful~!
[nl2]Wonderful! Marvelous![np]
[nl3]That's the king's gown
[scl]I remember!
[en1]

Good work. I'll go
[nl2]inform the king, so
[nl3]come along afterward.[np]
[scl]I'm sure the king will
[scl]be very pleased.
[en1]

You might even be
[nl2]better than me...[np]
[nl3]But don't go getting
[scl]any crazy ideas.[np]
[scl]Don't go dropping out
[scl]out of school to
[scl]become a painter.[np]
[scl]There's just no money
[scl]in it, you know.
[scl]
[en2]

[X$6A]I... I can't move with

[nl3]heat...
[en2]

[X$6A]
[nl2]  W... Wa... Water...
[en2]

[X$6A]I thought I heard

[nl3]Step aside.

This is the royal

[nl3]Solomon is inside and
[scl]they seem to be having

I could never face the
[nl2]departed Queen if any-
[nl3]thing happens to her.[np]
[scl]Please, hurry and save
[scl]the soldiers and
[scl]rescue Princess Polly!
[en2]

Even with the Ant
[nl2]Buster, they came on
[nl3]us in swarms...[np]
[scl]We never really stood
[scl]a snowball's chance
[scl]in hell.
[en2]

I hate to admit it,but 
[nl2]our remaining forces
[nl3]are insufficient...[np]
[scl]An attempt to rescue
[scl]Princess Polly would
[scl]only invite disaster.

Whoops, I forgot to
[nl2]tell gramps what was
[nl3]on the lunch menu![np]
[scl]We're having tomatoes.
[scl]Could you tell him

If anything happened

[scl]Please, you must save
[scl]her!
[en2]

Dear Solomon,[np]
[nl2]I've gone with Hassan
[nl3]to defeat the Blue
[scl]Things.[np]
[scl]I forced him to keep
[scl]this secret from you.
[scl]
[scl]If I hadn't, you would
[scl]have tried come along

[scl]If anything happens to
[scl]us, please take care

[scl]He's hopeless on his

[scl]Also, make sure those

[scl]I'll take care of the

Huh? This face....

Want to buy some

What? You don't know
[nl2]about Great Mecha?
[nl3]You guys are so lame.[np]
[scl]He's #3, but there's
[scl]also a #1 and #2.

[scl]I used to have those

[scl]But since I have #3
[scl]now, I don't really

[scl]Pew pew!
[scl]Bang! Pow! Bang!!
[scl]Cha-chaaang! Pew!!
[en2]

It's a toy robot. It
[nl2]winds up in the back.

Look at what you did!
[nl2]You've ruined it![np]
[nl3]You'd better pay for
[scl]this, you know!![np]
[scl]Just kidding, that
[scl]part falls off all the
[scl]time.[np]
[scl]It's an easy fix.
[en1]

Isn't there anyone who's
[nl2]on my level!?
[en2]

Keep this a secret
[nl2]from Jim...
[nl3]Come over here.
[en2]

We were doing a PK
[nl2]match, but the teacher
[nl3]embarrassed him.[np]
[scl]That made him super
[scl]PO'd. I don't know
[scl]what he'll do to us.

Look carefully at Jim's
[nl2]movement, and hit [BBtn]
[nl3]to kick it in![np]
[scl]Make sure to equip the
[scl]Soccer Shoes first!
[en1]

You're taking a man's
[nl2]challenge and then
[nl3]running away, eh?[np]
[scl][team] Team is a bunch
[scl]of cowards.
[scl]How disgraceful.
[en2]

Come on, nerds!
[nl2][np]
[nl3]You're gonna need to
[scl]focus if you want to
[scl]defeat my iron guard!
[en2]

Don't go spreading
[nl2]this around, but Jim
[nl3]is really reckless,[np]
[scl]so a feint can beat
[scl]him. To fake him out,
[scl]just switch leaders.
[en2]

Use [RBtn] to change
[nl2]your leader and trick
[nl3]Jim with a feint.[np]
[scl]That's the easiest way
[scl]to beat him!
[en2]

...That can't be----

[F2]Jim gave the fishing
[nl2]hook back![np]
[nl3]It has a feather for
[scl]bait.[np]
[scl]...But you can't use
[scl]a hook by itself.
[en1]

Haha, that was fun.
[nl2]Come and play again.
[nl3]I'll treat you right.[np]
[scl]Hey, you guys, get in
[scl]the tent!
[en1]

It is safe up to here.
[nl2]Let's continue.
[en1]

Du-ty. Com-plete.
[nl2]Good-bye.
[en1]

I tried to get the
[nl2]hook back from Jim,[np]
[nl3]but he challenged me
[scl]to a PK shootout.[np]
[scl]When I lost, he threw
[scl]my shoes into the
[scl]lake!
[en2]

Miss Gina told us to
[nl2]get some fish from the
[nl3]lake...[np]
[scl]...
[scl]Leader!
[scl]What do we do!?
[en2]

We were supposed to be
[nl2]in charge of fishing,[np]
[nl3]but goalkeeper Jim
[scl]took our hook and
[scl]won't give it back![np]
[scl]He's even supposed to
[scl]be helping us![np]
[scl]Man, if we can't get
[scl]some fish, Dorothy's
[scl]gonna hate us...[np]
[scl]I'm pretty weak against
[scl]forceful women... Err,
[scl]what was I saying?[np]
[scl]...*siiigh*
[scl]
[scl]
[en2]

Okay, if we combine
[nl2]that with this rod...[np]
[nl3]Alright!
[scl]A Fishing Rod.
[scl]You can have it.
[en1]

[F2]The fishing hook
[nl2]became a fishing rod.[np]
[nl3]Equip it and press [BBtn]
[scl]to use it. [np]
[scl]Hey, aren't you guys
[scl]on fishing duty? [np]
[scl]Hehehe.. actually,
[scl]I've never fished
[scl]before in my life.[np]
[scl]Sorry, but could you
[scl]get some fish for us?[np]
[scl]Press START and equip
[scl]the fishing rod, then
[scl]press [BBtn] to use it.[np]
[scl]Got it?
[en1]

To pull in a fish, you
[nl2]can't just hold the
[nl3]button down.[np]
[scl]You have to gently
[scl]apply the [CPad], okay?
[en2]

When you cast the rod,
[nl2]you hafta hold [BBtn] or
[nl3]it won't stay cast.[np]
[scl]Be careful!
[en2]

Hurry up with our
[nl2]fish![np]
[nl3]Actually, this

If we work together,
[nl2]we might be able to
[nl3]move it.

I see! If we switch
[nl2]the tiles here, we can

[en2]

Seems like they are

[nl3]Other items are

[scl]Did you know that?
[en2]

You can find out lots
[nl2]of things by using [Search]!
[en2]

You can't just yank on
[nl2]it, boy![np]
[nl3]Press [CPad] gently after
[scl]a fish bites.
[scl]Nice and easy...!
[en2]

Look at that geek over
[nl2]there, trying to boss
[nl3]me around![np]
[scl]He says it's because
[scl]Miss Gina made him a
[scl]leader...[np]
[scl]But honestly, how can
[scl]I take orders from
[scl]him?[np]
[scl]His face is tiny, and
[scl]his head is huge!
[scl]
[en2]

That egghead is sayin'
[nl2]he's in charge while
[nl3]Miss Gina's gone.[np]
[scl]What a little turd.
[en2]

...How do you move it
[nl2]again?
[en2]

Jim is still missing...
[nl2]I hope Miss Gina comes
[nl3]back soon.[np]
[scl]Who even cares about
[scl]Jim?! ...
[scl]
[en1]

Dear stinky brats,
[nl2]You guys suck.[np]
[nl3]Don't think you'll get
[scl]away with lifting my
[scl]treasure.[np]
[scl]So, I'm keeping an eye
[scl]on your smokin'
[scl]hot teacher.[np]
[scl]If you ever want to
[scl]see her again,[np]
[scl]come to the valley
[scl]past the lake.[np]
[scl]Don't forget my
[scl]Crystal Ball![np]
[scl] -The Greatest Pirate
[scl]  Under the Sky,
[scl]  King Blue
[en2]

B...But... Oh,
[nl2]Princess! Wait![np]
[nl3]Don't forget this
[scl]Super "Buster Cannon"!
[en1]

It seems like
[nl2]something wild was
[nl3]going on back there.[np]
[scl]What could it have
[scl]been?
[en2]

It's probably a lift
[nl2]leading to the other
[nl3]side.
[en2]

S... Someone!
[nl2]Miss Gina was...
[nl3]Taken by pirates!![np]
[scl]What do we do, [team]
[scl]Team?!
[en1]

It's no use, he can't
[nl2]hear us.
[nl3]Let's get closer.
[en2]

Miss Gina is in
[nl2]trouble!! ...What?
[nl3]You already know?[np]
[scl]They're holding her
[scl]hostage?[np]
[scl]They may be tiny, but
[scl]they seem serious.
[scl][np]
[scl]They busted up this
[scl]gate and headed to the
[scl]valley.[np]
[scl]What are you waiting
[scl]for?
[scl][np]
[scl]Hurry up and untie me!
[scl]
[en1]

Without a key, it
[nl2]looks impossible to
[nl3]remove...
[en2]

You found a key!!
[en2]

Squeak, squeak![np]
[nl2]TL: If you yank on it
[nl3]so fast, it doesn't
[scl]hurt~!!
[en2]

The fat one is lifting
[nl2]the tall one and the
[nl3]small one...[np]
[scl]Were there pirates
[scl]who looked like us way
[scl]back then?!
[en2]

En-er-gy. Drained...Pfffftt...  Re-gret!!
[en2]

Nope, it's way too
[nl2]tall to reach!
[en2]

Teamwork takes all 3
[nl2]of us!
[en2]

If we work together,
[nl2]we can even reach high
[nl3]places!
[en1]

So... So heavy![np]
[nl2]Max! Let's think this
[nl3]through before you
[scl]squish someone.
[en1]

If we work together...
[nl2]Haha! We did it!
[en1]

Wow! A treasure chest
[nl2]came out!
[en1]

Come on! You can't
[nl2]remove them from over
[nl3]there!
[en2]

T...Thank you so much,
[nl2][team] Team! I'm sorry
[nl3]I've been such a jerk.[np]
[scl]From now on, I swear
[scl]to turn over a new
[scl]leaf...[np]
[scl]
[scl]      ...Not!
[scl]
[en1]

[team] Team, come
[nl2]closer.
[en2]

Team, you were
[nl2]"pretty marvelous!"
[nl3]    T h e   E n d !
[en1]

So you did have the
[nl2]Crystal Ball![np]
[nl3]That will lead
[scl]us straight to
[scl]"Maverick's Treasure."[np]
[scl]Now, it will finally
[scl]be mine![np]
[scl]Patchies, place the
[scl]ball over there.
[en1]

Just you wait, the
[nl2]treasure will soon be
[nl3]ours!
[en1]

Even if you jump, it's
[nl2]too far... If only
[nl3]this box weren't here.
[en2]

Forgive me,
[nl2]Patchies...
[en2]

After they put the
[nl2]ball there, it started
[nl3]glowing...[np]
[scl]And the door...[np]
[scl]Miss Gina!
[scl]What happened to her!?
[scl]
[en2]

Isn't there a switch
[nl2]nearby?
[en2]

Some little kid
[nl2]showing off cuz he's
[nl3]taller than I am![np]
[scl]I won't let you go any
[scl]further!
[en2]

Leave us the ball and
[nl2]get out of here![np]
[nl3]With that treasure,
[scl]we can live out our
[scl]lives in luxury!
[en2]

You stole the Crystal
[nl2]Balls we were looking
[nl3]for...[np]
[scl]You took the keys
[scl]we wanted...
[scl][np]
[scl]Seriously, you guys
[scl]are worse than any
[scl]pirates I know!!
[en2]

Your teacher is quite
[nl2]a foxy lady. Our
[nl3]leader is ugly as sin.[np]
[scl]We're a little jealous
[scl]of you guys...
[scl]
[en2]

We'll get run over if
[nl2]we get too close...
[nl3]What should we do?
[en2]

The door is actually
[nl2]not very strong.
[nl3]That means...
[en2]

Ugh...[np]
[nl2]I can't take slamming
[nl3]up against this over
[scl]and over...[np]
[scl]It's really starting
[scl]to smart.
[en2]

You can't lift it
[nl2]alone...
[en2]

...There seems to be a
[nl2]trick to making it
[nl3]work.
[en2]

Let's get some speed
[nl2]and BOOM! Smash it!
[en1]

What's this...[np]
[nl2]"WE'RE SORRY!
[nl3]You're stuck here
[scl]forever, nerds!"[np]
[scl]Sarcastic AND rude!...
[scl]Humpfh!...
[scl]
[en2]

It says "Sisko's
[nl2]House." But the door
[nl3]is locked...
[en2]

No one seems to be
[nl2]home.
[en2]

Let's hurry up and get
[nl2]the Crystal Ball and
[nl3]get out of here!
[en2]

...Kweh kweh![np]
[nl2]TL: ...These guys seem
[nl3]suspicious!
[en2]

Let's get close and
[nl2]push it.
[en2]

Fugo. Fugo. Fugo![np]
[nl2]TL: Come here!
[en2]

What are you doing?!
[nl2]The dungeon door has
[nl3]been left open!
[en2]

My, myy.[np]
[nl2]TL: I've got the home.
[nl3]So now all I need...
[scl]Is a wife.
[en2]

Wha?! Who is this
[nl2]wrinkly old grandma?!
[en2]

Is this reality...!?
[nl2]If it's a dream, then
[nl3]wake me up now!
[en2]

Team, you were
[nl2]"sort of marvelous."
[nl3]    T h e   E n d !
[en1]

Team, you were
[nl2]"barely marvelous."
[nl3]    T h e   E n d !
[en1]

It looks like there
[nl2]was something big set
[nl3]here.
[en2]

Team, you were
[nl2]"almost marvelous."
[nl3]    T h e   E n d !
[en1]

Team, you were "not
[nl2]quite marvelous."
[nl3]    T h e   E n d !
[en1]

Team, you "should have
[nl2]tried a bit harder."
[nl3]    T h e   E n d !

Team, you "really
[nl2]need some work."
[nl3]    T h e   E n d !

[nl3]    T h e   E n d !
[en1]

Team, you were "very
[nl2]disappointing."
[nl3]    T h e   E n d !
[en1]

But what a terrible
[nl2]story...
[en2]

Feelin' lucky?
[nl2]Just try to get past!
[en2]

...This is just a
[nl2]feeling, but...[np]
[nl3]Aren't some of the
[scl]soldiers from the
[scl]castle missing?
[en2]

Hassan took the
[nl2]finished Ant Buster
[nl3]and left.[np]
[scl]He said he had to make
[scl]it stronger somehow...
[scl][np]
[scl]I think he went to
[scl]Princess Polly's room.
[en2]

All of our woes are
[nl2]due to those spineless
[nl3]bandits!
[en2]

He seemed to be a good
[nl2]person...[np]
[nl3]But he was actually
[scl]the leader of the
[scl]bandits...
[en2]

[F2]You received a Dog
[nl2]Bone![np]
[nl3]What a peculiar
[scl]sheriff~!
[en1]

We thought there was
[nl2]treasure in here so we
[nl3]came in.[np]
[scl]Then the door closed
[scl]and we were trapped!
[scl][np]
[scl]So what, you still
[scl]haven't found the
[scl]treasure?[np]
[scl]I don't want to get
[scl]hit by any more
[scl]lightning...[np]
[scl]So later gators!
[en1]

If you have something
[nl2]to say, come here and
[nl3]say it!
[en2]

The dog guarding the
[nl2]entrance to "Death
[nl3]Lake" is my pet.[np]
[scl]The only time he is
[scl]friendly is when he's
[scl]eating.[np]
[scl]Once he finishes his
[scl]food, he falls asleep
[scl]on the spot!
[en2]

[F2]Received -Another-
[nl2]Dog Bone!
[en1]

"Death Lake" is
[nl2]dangerous, so be
[nl3]careful.
[en2]

Hurry and find
[nl2]Indio's daughter in
[nl3]"Death Lake."[np]
[scl]Please save my boy!
[en2]

There's lots of
[nl2]interesting stuff in
[nl3]in this room.[np]
[scl]You should take a good
[scl]look around.
[scl]
[en2]

No two ways about it,
[nl2]this is a pirate!
[en2]

My late husband was
[nl2]the spitting image of
[nl3]grandpa here.[np]
[scl]The pirate blood runs
[scl]thick.
[en2]

Who is that pretty
[nl2]lady with that tough-
[nl3]looking kid?
[en2]

Oh, stop it, it's me
[nl2]when I was younger,
[nl3]of course![np]
[scl]I haven't changed that
[scl]much, have I?
[en2]

This's my only son,
[nl2]Blue.[np]
[nl3]He left town to try to
[scl]become a pirate just
[scl]like his father.[np]
[scl]This was long ago...
[scl]I wonder what he's
[scl]doing now...[np]
[scl]I hope he hasn't been
[scl]killed on some far
[scl]away island...
[en2]

We should take this
[nl2]child home right away.[np]
[nl3]I'm sure his mother is
[scl]worried.
[en1]

The people in town are
[nl2]all liars![np]
[nl3]Miss Sisko isn't a bad
[scl]person at all![np]
[scl]You've gotta believe
[scl]me![np]
[scl]You guys try talking
[scl]to her, too.[np]
[scl]I'm sure you'll be
[scl]able to see that she
[scl]isn't a bad person.
[en1]

The crow in the
[nl2]cemetery is guarding
[nl3]my father's grave.[np]
[scl]If he sees these
[scl]flowers, I'm sure
[scl]he'll remember me.
[en2]

Will you listen to
[nl2]what I have to say?
[en2]

I should be the one to
[nl2]do it...[np]
[nl3]But when I think of
[scl]the townspeople...[np]
[scl]I can't go outside.
[en2]

It's so sad... The
[nl2]child is in shock and
[nl3]can't say the truth.
[en2]

Miss Sisko is a nice
[nl2]person, see?
[en2]

Y'all really saved
[nl2]the day.
[en2]

[X$6A]As long as this crow
[nl2]is here, we can't get
[nl3]near the tombstone...
[en2]

It's the tombstone for
[nl2]Christopher Benson.
[en2]

There's a gap in the
[nl2]stone here... I think
[nl3]something's inside...
[en2]

From here you can't
[nl2]tell what it is.
[en2]

Caw, caw![np]
[nl2]TL: Sisko's flower!
[nl3][np]
[scl]Caw, caw![np]
[scl]TL: Indio's daughter
[scl]isn't bad! She's a
[scl]nice, pretty girl!
[en2]

If you want to check
[nl2]out the mansion to
[nl3]the East of here...[np]
[scl]An old lady is living
[scl]next door, so it's
[scl]easy to find.
[en2]

For bandits to steal
[nl2]"Treasure" from
[nl3]pirates...[np]
[scl]It sounds like a bad
[scl]joke...
[en2]

How can this be the
[nl2]only water left in
[nl3]town!?[np]
[scl]If only I could turn
[scl]back the hands of
[scl]time...[np]
[scl]I definitely should
[scl]have dug those
[scl]wells...
[en2]

Really, I would thank
[nl2]you for taking that
[nl3]junk off my hands...
[en2]

Grr... Ruff! Ruff![np]
[nl2]TL: This way leads to
[nl3]"Death Lake."[np]
[scl]It's a very dangerous
[scl]place, so I won't let
[scl]you pass!
[en2]

Gu-gu-gu-[np]
[nl2]TL: Zzzzzzz....
[en2]

What a spoiled dog!
[en2]

Where did you get this
[nl2]picture?[np]
[nl3]Everyone in this town
[scl]oughta recognize these
[scl]guys...
[en2]

It's the legendary
[nl2]pirate Christopher
[nl3]Benson, isn't it?[np]
[scl]He tried to take back
[scl]the "town's treasure"
[scl]and died doing it.[np]
[scl]He was buried in the
[scl]cemetery outside of
[scl]town.
[en2]

Indio was leading the
[nl2]bandits!![np]
[nl3]It's his fault they
[scl]attacked us, our water
[scl]dried up,[np]
[scl]and now nothing will
[scl]go our way.
[en2]

We called this the
[nl2]"town's treasure."[np]
[nl3]The legendary pirate, 
[scl]Christopher Benson,
[scl]once spoke of this...[np]
[scl]He said that it could
[scl]be used to find the
[scl]Maverick's Treasure.[np]
[scl]It's said the treasure
[scl]was hidden on some
[scl]other island...
[en2]

I know the guys in
[nl2]this picture all too
[nl3]well.
[en2]

It's Benson, yeah?[np]
[nl2]He was a good guy,
[nl3]but got taken in by
[scl]Indio.[np]
[scl]He said he could
[scl]use it to make a time
[scl]machine.[np]
[scl]Benson let Indio
[scl]borrow the "town's
[scl]treasure",[np]
[scl]but he got hoodwinked
[scl]by a master of
[scl]deception!
[en2]

This is Indio, the
[nl2]leader of the bandits,
[nl3]right?[np]
[scl]He tricked Benson with
[scl]promises of a "time
[scl]machine",[np]
[scl]and then the bandits
[scl]made off with the
[scl]"town's treasure."
[en2]

Now that Indio's dead,
[nl2]no one knows where the
[nl3]Crystal Ball is at.[np]
[scl]If you really want to
[scl]know so badly,[np]
[scl]make yourself a time
[scl]machine!
[en2]

I sort of recognize
[nl2]these people, but
[nl3]maybe not...
[en2]

Didn't this guy say
[nl2]"With Indio's help, I
[nl3]can time travel,"[np]
[scl]or something crazy
[scl]like that...?
[en2]

A long time ago, Indio
[nl2]fabricated outlandish
[nl3]stories.[np]
[scl]He said he could use
[scl]the "town's treasure" 
[scl]for a time machine...[np]
[scl]They couldn't have
[scl]been true stories,
[scl]right...?
[en2]

This crystal was the
[nl2]"town's treasure" to
[nl3]us,[np]
[scl]but to Indio it was a
[scl]piece of a time
[scl]machine.
[en2]

Wow, take a look at
[nl2]this picture!
[en2]

It's the legendary
[nl2]pirate Benson, isn't
[nl3]it?
[en2]

This guy is Indio...[np]
[nl2]The guy who fooled the
[nl3]legendary pirate
[scl]Benson, right?[np]
[scl]Indio filled Benson's
[scl]head with lies,[np]
[scl]but got caught trying
[scl]to make his escape.
[en2]

If you can find 4 of
[nl2]these Crystal Balls,[np]
[nl3]it's rumored they'll
[scl]unlock a marvelous
[scl]treasure...[np]
[scl]Benson found this one
[scl]and we kept it as the
[scl]"town's treasure."
[en2]

This is quite an old
[nl2]photograph...
[en2]

This man's wife lives
[nl2]next to the giant
[nl3]house in the East end.
[en2]

This man is the father
[nl2]of the girl who lives
[nl3]in "Death Lake."
[en2]

Only Indio knew where
[nl2]to find the "town's
[nl3]treasure."[np]
[scl]But dead men tell no
[scl]tales.
[en2]

What is this
[nl2]photograph?!
[en2]

Oh my, what a hunk.
[en2]

Ohoho, this is another
[nl2]fine man.
[nl3]Who could it be?
[en2]

What a pretty jewel.
[en2]

That's an old
[nl2]picture...
[en2]

I don't know...
[en2]

I don't know who it
[nl2]is...
[nl3]But his eyes look just
[scl]like Miss Sisko's!
[en2]

No idea...
[en2]

This picture was very
[nl2]special to my father.
[en2]

My father told me he
[nl2]had made a time
[nl3]machine.[np]
[scl]He used it in the hope
[scl]that this man would
[scl]see for himself[np]
[scl]that the water around
[scl]town would soon be
[scl]dried up.
[en2]

It's my father, Indio.
[nl2]He said he could
[nl3]travel through time.
[en2]

The people of this
[nl2]town believe this is a
[nl3]special item.[np]
[scl]They believe it leads
[scl]to an even greater
[scl]treasure.[np]
[scl]But to us, it's really
[scl]a component of the
[scl]"time machine."
[en2]

Oh wow, what are you
[nl2]doing with that photo?
[en2]

This is my husband
[nl2]when he was younger.[np]
[nl3]His name was
[scl]Christopher Benson.[np]
[scl]He once said, "I found
[scl]someone who can build
[scl]a time machine."[np]
[scl]He was quite convinced
[scl]that it was true, but
[scl]he had been deceived!
[en2]

When I met him, he
[nl2]didn't seem the type to
[nl3]steal things...
[en2]

My husband found a
[nl2]Crystal Ball.[np]
[nl3]He said that it was
[scl]supposed to lead to an
[scl]even greater treasure.[np]
[scl]Later, my son left
[scl]home in search of the
[scl]same Crystal Ball.
[en2]

[SImprtnt]Where did
[nl2]you find this photo?![np]
[nl3]Have you shown it to
[scl]anyone else?[np]
[scl]Keep this a secret,
[scl]but listen to me:[np]
[scl]Indio really did make
[scl]a time machine.[np]
[scl]The "Time Room" he
[scl]used is in the locked
[scl]up mansion.[np]
[scl]I don't know how he
[scl]did it,[np]
[scl]but here is a message
[scl]that Indio left
[scl]behind.
[en1]

The old lady over
[nl2]there should have the
[nl3]key to the mansion.
[en2]

Dang it, how could all
[nl2]the water dry up![np]
[nl3]I should have listened
[scl]to Indio and dug more
[scl]wells...
[en2]

[SImprtnt]There are 3
[nl2]clocks... The first
[nl3]one is at 10:00.[np]
[scl]The next one, at 9:30,
[scl]and the last one is at
[scl]10:30...[np]
[scl]
[scl]10:00, 9:30, 10:30...
[scl]
[en2]

I'll lend you the key,
[nl2]so come over here.
[en2]

Now you can enter the
[nl2]mansion.
[en1]

[F2]Received the Mansion
[nl2]Key![np]
[nl3]Now you can enter the
[scl]"Time Room"!
[en1]

Even now, when I look
[nl2]at that mansion,[np]
[nl3]I can still feel my
[scl]husband's presence...
[scl]So I can't go in...
[en2]

...Farewell...
[nl2]And thank you!
[en1]

You sure about that?
[en2]

You're really sure
[nl2]about that?
[en2]

The oldest one is to

[scl]The youngest one is to

[en2]

I wonder what will be

Is lunch ready yet?[np]
[nl2]What is Dorothy
[nl3]planning on making,

The King's hobby is

[nl3]Supposedly, there is a

[scl]behind the castle...[np]
[scl]But I've never
[scl]actually seen it.
[scl]
[en2]

It doesn't seem too
[nl2]heavy.
[en2]

I never thought I'd
[nl2]see you all again. I'm
[nl3]so glad I was wrong.[np]
[scl]You must have had a

[scl]Mr. Arnold? I see, Mr.
[scl]Arnold came to help
[scl]out. That's good.[np]
[scl]Let's get out of here.
[scl]According to what the
[scl]Patchies said,[np]
[scl]the only way out is to
[scl]use the elevator
[scl]behind the blue door.[np]
[scl]I found a blue box in
[scl]here...
[scl][np]
[scl]I bet the key to the
[scl]elevator door is
[scl]inside.[np]
[scl]But no matter what
[scl]I did, I couldn't
[scl]open it.[np]
[scl]Can you boys do
[scl]something with it?
[en1]

I wonder what's for
[nl2]lunch~.
[en2]

What? Lunch is another
[nl2]tomato dish!?[np]
[nl3]You came all the way
[scl]here just to tell me
[scl]that?[np]
[scl]Well, aren't you nice
[scl]boys.
[scl]
[en2]

You guys are pretty
[nl2]nice.
[en2]

Bzzt! Wrong item,
[nl2]Deon!
[en2]

Come on, Deon, you
[nl2]know better than that.
[en2]

Using that item makes
[nl2]no sense, Jack.
[en2]

Did you open the 3
[nl2]types of treasure
[nl3]chest in the ship?[np]
[scl]The place to use the
[scl]Small Key is west of
[scl]the ship.
[en1]

There are 4 handles
[nl2]that extend outward
[nl3]from the switch.[np]
[scl]Each time you move one
[scl]position in any
[scl]direction,[np]
[scl]the numbers will
[scl]change.
[scl][np]
[scl]Turning to the Right
[scl](右) will cause White
[scl]numbers to appear.[np]
[scl]Turning to the Left
[scl](左) will cause Black
[scl]numbers to appear.[np]
[scl]If the levers are
[scl]turned too far in any
[scl]direction,[np]
[scl]the number will be
[scl]reset, understand?
[scl][np]
[scl]If you want another 
[scl]tip, I'll need [num] more
[scl]Luck Rock from you.[np]
[scl] What do you say?[X$6A][np]
[scl]    Tell me more.
[scl]    Nah, I got it.[X$68]
[en1]

I'll tell you the
[nl2]correct way to rotate
[nl3]it...[np]
[scl]Right [Two] times,
[scl]Left [Five] times, and
[scl]Right [Four] times.[np]
[scl]...I'm pretty sure
[scl]that was it.
[en1]

Did you find a lever
[nl2]in the cave shaped
[nl3]like a fish?[np]
[scl]Speaking of fish...
[scl]Now you get it, right?
[scl]
[en1]

It's almost lunch
[nl2]time, so let's head
[nl3]back!
[en1]

Jim is in trouble
[nl2]across the river![np]
[nl3]We need the key that
[scl]the fish ate.[np]
[scl]Look closely to see
[scl]which fish ate it!
[scl]
[en1]

Try using your "Mitt
[nl2]and Ball" on things in
[nl3]your way!
[en1]

Are you stuck with the
[nl2]pipe?[np]
[nl3]Did you know a short
[scl]enough kid can fit
[scl]inside?
[en1]

Is there a better way?
[nl2]If you think of one,
[nl3]tell me, okay?
[en2]

We have to get this
[nl2]child home...[np]
[nl3]I'm sure his mother is
[scl]worried!
[en2]

Thank you, my father
[nl2]loved this flower.[np]
[nl3]If you show it to the
[scl]crow, I'm sure he'll
[scl]remember me.
[en1]

I was an idiot for
[nl2]asking [team] Team.[np]
[nl3]From now on, I'm
[scl]calling you Sissy
[scl]Team.
[en2]

Soccer is getting
[nl2]boring.
[en2]

Let's do it again
[nl2]sometime.
[en2]

Don't let Jim know we
[nl2]told you, but...[np]
[nl3]He has a crush on Miss
[scl]Gina!
[scl]
[en2]

If only you had some
[nl2]"Soccer Shoes"...[np]
[nl3]With "Soccer Shoes,"
[scl]you could kick this
[scl]ball like a champ...
[en2]

Why is this mansion
[nl2]the only locked
[nl3]building?
[en2]

[F2]The door opened![np]
[nl2]Where could the
[nl3]"Time Room" be?
[en2]

I can still recall a
[nl2]little bit about the
[nl3]town's history.
[en2]

Caw caw![np]
[nl2]TL: You guys are
[nl3]alright.
[en2]

My dog falls straight
[nl2]asleep after eating,
[nl3]so don't worry.
[en1]

This is my husband's
[nl2]grandfather.
[en1]

This is...
[en1]

Instead of a ghost, I
[nl2]wish a sprout would
[nl3]come out...
[en2]

A ghost wouldn't come
[nl2]out in the daytime~.
[en2]

A... A shadow...!
[en2]

I wonder if he's
[nl2]really here?
[en2]

Even if he's a ghost,
[nl2]he's awfully shy...
[en2]

I've always been bad
[nl2]with ghosts and
[nl3]frogs....
[en2]

Indio's daughter must
[nl2]be behind this!
[en2]

It's a little scary,
[nl2]but exciting, too!
[en2]

Shall we give him a
[nl2]shake...?
[en2]

It's not that I don't
[nl2]trust you...[np]
[nl3]I made a promise not
[scl]to disclose any
[scl]personal information.[np]
[scl]Especially not my
[scl]name, or where I came
[scl]from.
[en2]

What's that picture?
[nl2]It's too far for me to
[nl3]see it well...
[en2]

Hey, it's me and
[nl2]Indio![np]
[nl3]I don't remember
[scl]having this picture
[scl]taken...[np]
[scl]
[scl]Just who are you kids?
[scl]
[en1]

What in tarnation!?
[nl2]The "Blue Crystal" was
[nl3]stolen by bandits?![np]
[scl]How do you know?! If
[scl]that's true, we're in
[scl]serious trouble![np]
[scl]I know where the
[scl]hideout of the
[scl]"Mammoth Brothers" is,[np]
[scl]so let's go save
[scl]Indio![np]
[scl]I'll take that picture
[scl]if you don't mind.
[scl]
[en2]

Let's hurry!
[en2]

Watch this!!
[en1]

We should be able to
[nl2]enter through here.
[nl3]Hurry!
[en1]

Come over here.
[en2]

Maybe if we search
[nl2]somewhere else I'll
[nl3]remember.
[en1]

Won't you try sailing
[nl2]the seven seas as a
[nl3]pirate?
[en2]

What kind of joke is
[nl2]it for bandits to
[nl3]attack pirates?
[en2]

Why don't you see for
[nl2]yourself?
[en2]

Blue!
[nl2]Behave yourself!!
[en2]

My mommy is pretty,
[nl2]isn't she?
[en2]

When I get older, I
[nl2]want to be a teacher!
[en2]

What kind of bird egg
[nl2]is this...?
[nl3]...What?!
[en1]

[F2]A baby crow hatched!
[en2]

Wow! Cool!
[en1]

I wonder how to make
[nl2]the flower open up...
[en2]

Maybe a good kick will
[nl2]do the trick!
[en2]

If you get too close,
[nl2]the thorns will poke
[nl3]you...
[en2]

Well blast me
[nl2]barnacles![np]
[nl3]The time warp worked!
[scl]Indio was telling the
[scl]truth![np]
[scl]So I've come to the
[scl]future...?[np]
[scl]Did the water really
[scl]dry up like Indio
[scl]said?!
[en1]

This Crystal Ball will
[nl2]lead us to the
[nl3]legendary treasure![np]
[scl]Doesn't sound like
[scl]you'll be needing this
[scl]anymore, does it?[np]
[scl]Sorry, but we'll be
[scl]taking it, then!!
[scl]
[en1]

We'll just let the
[nl2]townspeople handle the
[nl3]rest.[np]
[scl]
[scl]Look forward to it!
[scl]
[en1]

Press the [BBtn] button
[nl2]to punch, hold it to
[nl3]guard! Okay!?
[en1]

Hehehe, later!
[en1]

The "town's treasure"
[nl2]is gone![np]
[nl3]You stole it, didn't
[scl]you, Indio?![np]
[scl]I just received an 
[scl]anonymous tip about
[scl]you!
[en1]

You're under arrest!
[en1]

Thanks for assisting
[nl2]in the arrest, boys![np]
[nl3]Now we know that Indio
[scl]is the leader of the
[scl]mountain bandits.
[en1]

Wow! You opened it!
[nl2]That key will probably
[nl3]open the blue door...[np]
[scl]Let's go there right
[scl]away.
[scl]
[en1]

...Isn't there another
[nl2]way to look inside?
[en2]

Without getting much
[nl2]closer, you can't see.
[en2]

[X$6A]Oh, there they are!
[nl2]What are they talking
[nl3]about?
[en2]

I didn't steal the
[nl2]crystal ball! I swear!
[nl3]But more importantly,[np]
[scl]we need to dig more
[scl]wells or the town will
[scl]run out of water![np]
[scl]I asked the boy at the
[scl]lake to dig the
[scl]holes...[np]
[scl]Can you find him and
[scl]help him?[np]
[scl]Unless those wells get
[scl]dug, and get dug fast,[np]
[scl]the town will be in
[scl]huge trouble!
[en2]

The town will run out
[nl2]of water?[np]
[nl3]You asked the boy at
[scl]the lake to dig wells?
[scl]Enough lies![np]
[scl]Tell me where you hid
[scl]the "town's treasure!"
[scl]
[en2]

Indio asked me for a
[nl2]favor...[np]
[nl3]Do you guys know where
[scl]he is right now?
[en2]

Indio said this lake
[nl2]will dry up soon,[np]
[nl3]so he asked me to dig
[scl]some wells...[np]
[scl]To dig a well, I'll
[scl]need the help of these
[scl]penguins here.[np]
[scl]They have a mysterious
[scl]power that enables
[scl]them to sense water.[np]
[scl]But these penguins are
[scl]in the middle of
[scl]mating season![np]
[scl]I can't get any of
[scl]them to leave the
[scl]lake.[np]
[scl]  Help me catch one?[X$6A] 
[scl]    Okay, sure!
[scl]    Do it yourself![X$68]
[en1]

That's the spirit![np]
[nl2]I'll head back and
[nl3]wait for you guys to
[scl]bring me a penguin.
[en1]

I can't because...
[nl2]I can't swim!
[en2]

You don't have
[nl2]anything to dig with?[np]
[nl3]Okay, I'll give you my
[scl]invention, a "hole
[scl]digging machine!"[np]
[scl]...Is what I'd like to
[scl]say, but I only have
[scl]the concept drawn up.[np]
[scl]I'll give it to the
[scl]kid who likes building
[scl]stuff the most.
[en2]

I'd like to give you
[nl2]the "hole digging
[nl3]machine" I designed,[np]
[scl]but I only have the
[scl]plan for it.[np]
[scl]You'll have to find
[scl]the parts on your own.
[scl]
[en1]

[F2]Received hole Digging
[nl2]Machine Blueprints![np]
[nl3]I think I've seen
[scl]these parts before...
[en1]

My gut tells me there
[nl2]are [Three] spots in town
[nl3]just right for a well.
[en1]

If we don't dig them
[nl2]fast, it'll be a
[nl3]disaster!
[en2]

[F2]You made a Hole
[nl2]Digging Machine!
[en1]

But it's too heavy to
[nl2]lift.
[nl3]Max, you take it!
[en2]

Let's make Max carry
[nl2]it!
[en2]

[nl2]Get it together, Jack.
[en2]

[SP$012C]Moo~ moo~.
[nl2]TL: Moo moo.

Let's get closer and
[nl2]try something...
[en2]

[SP$012C]Mrroo~ moooo.[np]
[nl2]TL: I'm really
[nl3]ticklish, so don't
[scl]come any closer!
[en2]

You scoundrels! Is
[nl2]this any way to treat
[nl3]a lady?!
[en1]

[F2]You did it![np]
[nl2]Now the town will
[nl3]always have plenty of
[scl]water![np]
[scl]Thank you! I'll keep
[scl]this penguin.[np]
[scl]Oh, you guys, I have
[scl]something interesting
[scl]to tell you.[np]
[scl]If you want to save
[scl]Indio, get a frog.[np]
[scl]The sheriff hates
[scl]frogs more than
[scl]anything!
[en1]

Thanks to you kids,
[nl2]the town's water
[nl3]problems were solved.[np]
[scl]Now we have to save

Let's look for the
[nl2]blue door elevator.[np]
[nl3]I think it was below
[scl]the room I was trapped
[scl]in.
[en2]

Yikes! A frog!!
[nl2]Help me!!
[en1]

The guy on the left is
[nl2]Benson! And I'm next
[nl3]to him...[np]
[scl]Where did you get
[scl]this?[np]
[scl]I don't remember
[scl]posing for this...[np]
[scl]You kids are time
[scl]travelers?![np]
[scl]Please, take this
[scl]photograph and look
[scl]for Benson!
[en2]

Eh? You say you know
[nl2]Benson?[np]
[nl3]It's not that I don't
[scl]believe you, but do
[scl]you have any proof?
[en2]

You guys must be time
[nl2]travelers![np]
[nl3]I am sure you will be
[scl]able to find Benson!
[en2]

Time, please protect
[nl2]these children...
[en2]

Which one do you think
[nl2]is good?
[nl3]Point to it.
[en2]

[SUnkwn2]I see, the one with
[nl2]just a window...[np]
[nl3]Yeah, simple is good!
[en1]

[SUnkwn2]I see, the one with a
[nl2]door AND a window...[np]
[nl3]Yeah, without a door,
[scl]you can't get inside,
[scl]can you??
[en1]

[SUnkwn2]I see, the one with a
[nl2]door on top...[np]
[nl3]Yeah, then if it
[scl]snows, I can still get
[scl]out!
[en1]

[SUnkwn2]Oh, the one with lots
[nl2]of windows...[np]
[nl3]Good idea, then it
[scl]will be really bright
[scl]inside!
[en1]

Thanks![np]
[nl2]When I finish it, I'd
[nl3]like to show it to
[scl]you...[np]
[scl]But there's still a
[scl]long ways to go...[np]
[scl]Come back when you're
[scl]adults!
[en1]

[One2] isn't any good?
[nl2]Okay, then pick your
[nl3]favorite.
[en2]

Yippee!
[nl2]The door opened!
[en2]

Actually... M...my
[nl2]hip went out and I
[nl3]can't move...
[en2]

...But.
[en1]

It seems like fun, so
[nl2]I'll do it!
[en1]

[F2]You got some Dynamite![np]
[nl2]Equip it and use it
[nl3]with the [BBtn] button!
[en1]

Max, try to think
[nl2]before using an item.
[en2]

Can you come a little
[nl2]closer?
[en2]

Stop dawdling and use
[nl2]the dynamite to find
[nl3]an entrance!
[en2]

Want to try it with
[nl2]-BOOM- one shot?
[en2]

Who is holding the
[nl2]dynamite?
[en2]

Alright, I've taken
[nl2]the dynamite back.[np]
[nl3]When I use this, it
[scl]will send up a lot of
[scl]smoke.[np]
[scl]So don't get lost!
[en1]

As long as our masks
[nl2]are on, you'll never
[nl3]get past us!
[en2]

It's too hard to push
[nl2]by hand...
[en2]

It's pretty heavy...
[en2]

To use teamwork, we
[nl2]have to position
[nl3]ourselves better.
[en2]

If we pull it like
[nl2]this, we'll be
[nl3]squished!
[en2]

Want to get down?
[en2]

Without a bridge, we
[nl2]can't cross.
[en2]

Captain, what's the
[nl2]hurry?[np]
[nl3]...But even in a hurry,
[scl]your face looks great!

If you don't hurry,
[nl2]the Mammoth Brothers

[en2]

You're pretty bold to
[nl2]try to steal anything
[nl3]from us![np]
[scl]Hey you!
[scl]The punk with the
[scl]hat...![np]
[scl]You'll be the first to
[scl]taste our Dance of

[en1]

So you're the leader?!
[en2]

Don't think you can
[nl2]escape from us!
[en2]

........
[en2]

Listen to what they're
[nl2]saying!
[en2]

If you don't push it
[nl2]quickly, the Mammoth
[nl3]guys will wake up.
[en2]

If you return to the
[nl2]other world, give me a
[nl3]visit, okay?
[en2]

If you return to the
[nl2]other world, give me a
[nl3]visit, okay?
[en2]

Thank goodness he was
[nl2]found innocent!
[en2]

It's a message Benson
[nl2]left for us!
[nl3]...What does it mean?
[en2]

Is something there?
[en2]

Come here and look at
[nl2]the blueprint!
[en2]

What is this
[nl2]picture...?
[en2]

Oh, it's Benson!
[en2]

Indio came to see
[nl2]Benson. He said the
[nl3]town was in trouble.
[en2]

What's the Crystal Ball
[nl2]called that leads to
[nl3]Maverick's Treasure?[np]
[scl]It's called the Blue
[scl]Blue Crystal, right?
[en2]

Hmm... What is this
[nl2]picture?
[en2]

Well, if it isn't
[nl2]Benson!
[en2]

It's a picture of when
[nl2]Indio met with Benson!
[en2]

The "Town's Treasure"
[nl2]was in Benson's hou...
[nl3]Hou... Achoo!!! House.[np]
[scl]I'm sure of it.
[en2]

What's with this
[nl2]picture?
[en2]

It's Benson!
[nl2]He was a strong, fine
[nl3]man.
[en2]

It's Indio![np]
[nl2]He lives on the other
[nl3]side of penguin lake
[scl]with his daughter.
[en2]

It's the "Town's
[nl2]Treasure."[np]
[nl3]But Indio said it was
[scl]part of a time
[scl]machine.
[en2]

Where'd you get this
[nl2]picture?!
[en2]

It's my husband. When
[nl2]did he take this
[nl3]photograph...?
[en2]

It's the man who came
[nl2]to see my husband.[np]
[nl3]He said he knew how to
[scl]travel through time...[np]
[scl]I wonder if it was
[scl]true.
[en2]

It's the Crystal Ball
[nl2]my husband found.
[en2]

What is this picture?!
[en2]

It's my dad!
[en2]

I dunno!
[en2]

I haven't the
[nl2]slightest idea!
[en2]

What is this photo?
[en2]

It's the old man who
[nl2]lent us this house!

Without a ship, these

[nl3]seem like pirates...

I'm high on life!!

[nl2]understand.[np]

"How to Pirate"
[nl2]It looks like a good

I want it a little

We want to sleep in a

Can you imagine trying

[nl3]around?!

This isn't pirate
[nl2]gear, right...?
[en2]

I wonder if it's still
[nl2]in use.

[nl2]schoolteacher.[np]
[nl3]She's very respectable
[scl]just like her father.[np]
[scl]Benson's son is...
[scl]Well... Nobody knows
[scl]where he went to.
[en2]

Miss Sisko reminds
[nl2]you of Miss Gina.
[en2]

Studying is all well
[nl2]and good.[np]
[nl3]But sometimes you need
[scl]play outside!
[en2]

It's so nice to study
[nl2]under the great blue
[nl3]sky.
[en2]

This is Miss Sisko's
[nl2]class, but she's
[nl3]running late~...
[en2]

If you don't like
[nl2]studying, you should
[nl3]try Miss S's classes![np]
[scl]They're really easy to
[scl]understand.
[en2]

Hey, isn't Miss Sisko
[nl2]just wonderful?
[en2]

Miss Sisko is a great
[nl2]teacher, isn't she?
[en2]

When you get home, say
[nl2]hi to your teacher for
[nl3]me.
[en2]

Isn't it a great
[nl2]house?
[en2]

This is where life
[nl2]begins!
[en2]

[nl2]  Hey![C$56] Wait for me!
[en2]

Meow~, meow~.
[en2]

I feel like everything
[nl2]is different than it
[nl3]used to be...
[en2]

Did you remember our
[nl2]promise?
[en2]

What's with this
[nl2]picture...
[en2]

I dunno...
[en2]

Couldn't tell ya...
[en2]

Never seen it before
[nl2]in my life...
[en2]

It doesn't look like
[nl2]it gets used much.
[en2]

It doesn't seem like
[nl2]we can lift it...
[en2]

I want it~...
[en2]

What could it be used
[nl2]for...?
[en2]

You shouldn't decorate
[nl2]your house with
[nl3]something like this.[np]
[scl]It'll just add to the
[scl]clutter!
[en2]

Decorating your house
[nl2]with something like
[nl3]this'll just look bad.
[en2]

The treasure chest
[nl2]won't open like that!
[en2]

It's made of gold?
[nl2]That's kinda weird!
[en2]

Ah, hah!
[en2]

Whose grave is
[nl2]this...?
[en2]

I wonder what this
[nl2]black stone is for?
[en2]

Pegi, pegi, pegi~.[np]
[nl2]TL: It's not so bad
[nl3]being a human's pet~.
[en2]

[X$6A]Oh, right! The
[nl2]leader hat. I'm not
[nl3]the leader anymore.[np]
[scl]...Please save Miss
[scl]Gina!
[scl]
[en1]

If you're the leader,
[nl2]then do something
[nl3]about it!
[en2]

Thanks for your hard
[nl2]work!
[en2]

There's lots of
[nl2]firewood near the
[nl3]lake.
[en2]

......Got it.
[nl2]I'll go call for help.[np]
[nl3]You just sit tight and
[scl]wait for help to
[scl]arrive.
[en1]

What, a time bomb!?
[nl2]That's intense.[np]
[nl3]Hurry up and get out
[scl]of here!
[en1]

Oh hii~! It's been far
[nl2]too long~.[np]
[nl3]Things sure seem to be
[scl]getting crazy.
[scl]On my way here I...
[en1]

Golly, you sure do
[nl2]talk a lot. Now's not
[nl3]the time for that.[np]
[scl]Time is of the
[scl]essence.
[scl]Okay?[np]
[scl]It might be scary, but
[scl]wind from below should
[scl]slow your descent...[np]
[scl]I'm sure you'll be fine.
[scl]Okay, let's do it.
[en1]

Who would have thought
[nl2]there was a balloon
[nl3]hidden here?
[en2]

We have to think fast.[np]
[nl2]With our weights...
[nl3]Someone heavy should
[scl]go on the left...[np]
[scl]The two others will
[scl]pump from the right
[scl]side.
[en1]

[SStop]This is my greatest
[nl2]invention.[np]
[nl3]People thought it was
[scl]impossible for humans
[scl]to fly, [np]
[scl]but this hot air
[scl]balloon allows humans
[scl]to do just that.[np]
[scl]This is the treasure I
[scl]leave to anyone who is
[scl]able to find it.[np]
[scl]It's also the only way
[scl]to escape from the
[scl]dungeon.[np]
[scl]I pray this device
[scl]still works when you
[scl]find it.[np]
[scl]
[scl]   Captain Maverick
[en2]

Let's hurry and push
[nl2]it.
[en2]

[X$79]  Press to pump it!
[nl2]        [C$12][X$7E]
[en1]

Hurrah! The balloon is
[nl2]inflated!
[nl3]Let's hurry and get in!
[en1]

I'll let you have my
[nl2]"Soccer Shoes."[np]
[nl3]You'll find them at
[scl]the bottom of the
[scl]lake!
[en2]

[SDenied]Come on, you
[nl2]aren't even wearing
[nl3]"Soccer Shoes!"[np]
[scl]So how are you going
[scl]to play soccer?[np]
[scl]Come back when you
[scl]wise up.
[en2]

If you don't go
[nl2]underwater, you can't
[nl3]reach the shoes...[np]
[scl]But it looks like the
[scl]water will hurt your
[scl]eyes~.
[en2]

We need your help![X$6A]
[nl2]    Okay.
[nl3]    Nope.[X$68]
[en1]

Oof, that's harsh.
[en2]

Use [RBtn] to change the
[nl2]leader and bring them
[nl3]to the pot one by one.[np]
[scl]Then, press [TWork]!!
[en2]

Seems like we could
[nl2]have just filled it
[nl3]from the river...
[en2]

Sakes alive am I
[nl2]tired...
[en2]

Let's try it like
[nl2]them...[np]
[nl3]They said to position
[scl]ourselves equally
[scl]around the pot, right?
[en2]

Hm, something seems
[nl2]off...[np]
[nl3]Maybe our positions
[scl]aren't right?
[en1]

Yay! We lifted the
[nl2]pot!!
[en1]

Half the water
[nl2]splashed out![np]
[nl3]Thanks, [team] Team,
[scl]we were in hot water.[np]
[scl]Now we can lift the
[scl]pot ourselves.
[en1]

After you get the
[nl2]"fish hook" back from
[nl3]Jim,[np]
[scl]show it to our leader.
[scl]He's pretty bummed out
[scl]over it...
[en2]

Whoa!
[nl2]   A bite!!!
[en1]

This is a big one!
[nl2]It's too big for me to
[nl3]pull it in alone![np]
[scl]Someone, help me reel
[scl]it in!
[en1]

It's heavy, so it has
[nl2]to be something big![np]
[nl3]Don't stand there,
[scl]come and help!
[en2]

Hurry! It'll get
[nl2]away!!
[en2]

[F2]Max got Swimming
[nl2]Goggles![np]
[nl3]You can use them with
[scl][BBtn] to see underwater.[np]
[scl][X$6A]Ugh, it's just another
[scl]piece of junk.[np]
[scl]I thought that was
[scl]gonna be the big
[scl]one...[np]
[scl]To use the goggles,
[scl]open the menu with
[scl]START and equip them.[np]
[scl]Got it?
[en1]

Fugo, fugo.[np]
[nl2]TL: Oh, even if you
[nl3]land on us, it won't
[scl]hurt you,[np]
[scl]so don't worry.
[en2]

What's this?
[nl2]"Camp Tips"...!?[np]
[nl3]Point at each line
[scl]with [CrDn] to read them.
[en2]

When you think "Huh?!"
[nl2]press the [ABtn] button.[np]
[nl3]When you think "That's
[scl]fishy!" press the [ABtn]
[scl]button![np]
[scl]There's a lot to
[scl]explore!
[en2]

If you see a [QBub] then
[nl2]it's time to press [ABtn].[np]
[nl3]Also, when you touch
[scl]people or objects, the
[scl][QBub] will pop up...[np]
[scl]You'll want to push
[scl]the [ABtn] button whenever
[scl]you can!
[en2]

Perform actions with
[nl2]the [BBtn] button.[np]
[nl3]Equip an item from the
[scl]START menu and use it
[scl]with [BBtn]...[np]
[scl]Let's try it out.
[en2]

When you're in trouble,
[nl2]try whistling![np]
[nl3]When your team is
[scl]split up, just use the
[scl]whistle...!
[en2]

Squeak, squeak![np]
[nl2]TL: I'm a prankster
[nl3]mouse.[np]
[scl]If you hear a scream,
[scl]it's probably thanks
[scl]to me.
[en2]

[X$6A]This seems to
[nl2]be a path for mice.
[en2]

[team] Team... please!
[nl2]I'm... begging you!
[nl3]Do somethiiiiing!!
[en2]

Find the hole the
[nl2]mouse used to get in
[nl3]and chase it away![np]
[scl]Pretty please, [team]
[scl]Team?
[en2]

[X$6A]Find the hole in
[nl2]the tent where mice
[nl3]could come in,[np]
[scl]and make it so they'll
[scl]never think about
[scl]coming in here again.[np]
[scl]Pretty please, [team]
[scl]Team?
[en2]

[X$6A]You plugged the
[nl2]hole in the tent
[nl3]earlier,[np]
[scl]and the mouse ran
[scl]away?[np]
[scl]I wonder if he's
[scl]gone for good...
[en2]

Squeak!...Squeak![np]
[nl2]TL: Dang it! I'm
[nl3]trapped! Don't lay a
[scl]finger on me!
[en2]

Squeeeeak eeek!![np]
[nl2]TL: Don't pull there!!
[nl3]Aaaargh...!
[en1]

I want to show my
[nl2]thanks to you, [team]
[nl3]Team.[np]
[scl]Come closer to me.
[en2]

[F2]Received a Matching
[nl2]Scarf from Miss Gina![np]
[nl3]Keep it a secret,
[scl]okay?
[en1]

I think it's awfully
[nl2]nice to help people in
[nl3]trouble.[np]
[scl]If you see more
[scl]people in trouble,[np]
[scl]be sure to help them
[scl]out, too, okay?
[en1]

You can put items in
[nl2]this wooden box...[np]
[nl3]But you can't put them
[scl]in from that far away.[np]
[scl]Get a little closer.
[en2]

Yes, you put items in
[nl2]this box.[np]
[nl3]Don't worry... It's not
[scl]like the item will
[scl]disappear or anything.
[en2]

Don't you get it?[np]
[nl2]Don't give ME the
[nl3]item, put it in the
[scl]box.[np]
[scl]Try checking the box
[scl]with [Search].
[en2]

It seems that is the
[nl2]wrong item.[np]
[nl3]Why don't you try with
[scl]another item?[np]
[scl]You'll be glad you
[scl]did.
[en1]

That's correct.
[nl2]This box multiplies
[nl3]Luck Rocks.[np]
[scl]Go ahead and take
[scl]them.
[en1]

[X$6A][SChing][num] Luck Rock turned
[nl2]into [Five][LuckRock].[np]
[nl3]This is what is called
[scl]a "miracle."
[en1]

If you can do this,
[nl2]then you're an item
[nl3]master.[np]
[scl]Be sure to continue
[scl]studying every day.
[en1]

I forgot to mention
[nl2]it, but no more Luck
[nl3]Rocks will come out...[np]
[scl]Life isn't that easy.
[en1]

Let's get closer and
[nl2]take it.
[en2]

Let's chase it down
[nl2]and grab it!
[en2]

Without diving
[nl2]underwater, we can't
[nl3]reach it...[np]
[scl]I wonder how one can
[scl]dive underwater...
[en2]

Guwah! How can you be
[nl2]stumped by such a
[nl3]simple trap?![np]
[scl]For shame, kids...
[scl]
[scl]These "Patchies" are
[scl]ordered 2, 1, 3 from
[scl]the left.[np]
[scl]That's a huge hint!
[scl]So...[np]
[scl]If you still don't get
[scl]it, you are just dumb.
[en1]

The Patchies blocking
[nl2]the cave are really in
[nl3]the way.[np]
[scl]What if we tried
[scl]knocking them over
[scl]with a ball?
[en1]

Try bumping into logs
[nl2]with "Dash."
[nl3]Then you can lift the
[scl]log with [TWork].
[en1]

You want to save Miss
[nl2]Gina, don't you?[np]
[nl3]Then hurry up and find
[scl]the Crystal Ball![np]
[scl]There's a path next to
[scl]where Blue collapsed.
[scl]
[en1]

What should you do
[nl2]from here?[np]
[nl3]...All you can do is
[scl]leave the island on
[scl]that ship, right?[np]
[scl]You have to open the
[scl]unopenable door in the
[scl]ship to move it.[np]
[scl]Did you already meet a
[scl]miniature person?[np]
[scl]If not, then look
[scl]along the coast in the
[scl]North and save them.[np]
[scl]Then you can open the
[scl]door.
[en1]

[X$6A][SChing]You got [X$6B] Luck Rocks.
[en1]

What are you doing?
[nl2]What? I won't do
[nl3]anything. Come closer.
[en2]

What's inside the
[nl2]chest?
[en2]

Gah! I have [Zero] Luck
[nl2]Rocks left...
[nl3]Dang it...[np]
[scl]...My store... is
[scl]ruined!!
[scl]Get out of here!
[en1]

...What are you going
[nl2]to do with all those
[nl3]Luck Rocks?[np]
[scl]Weren't you supposed
[scl]to be collecting
[scl]firewood?
[en2]

Don't you have
[nl2]anything better to do?
[nl3]...Buzz off!
[en2]

I wonder if we were a
[nl2]little cruel to Jim?
[en2]

Hey, guess what, you
[nl2]guys?[np]
[nl3]You have [Zero] Luck
[scl]Rocks. Didn't notice?[np]
[scl]I'll take pity on you
[scl]and give you [num] Luck
[scl]Rock for the road.[np]
[scl]You should really quit
[scl]while you're ahead.
[en1]

[SChing]You received [num] Luck
[nl2]Rock from Jim.[np]
[nl3]He might not be so bad
[scl]after all...
[en2]

These are the Luck
[nl2]Rocks we painstakingly
[nl3]collected.[np]
[scl]Don't think you'll
[scl]take them all for
[scl]nothing.[np]
[scl]Give it a try if
[scl]you're feeling lucky.
[en2]

...Dang it, Jim![np]
[nl2]Those are the Luck
[nl3]Rocks we worked so
[scl]hard to get...
[en2]

Is it okay to do this?[np]
[nl2]If Miss Gina finds
[nl3]out,[np]
[scl]I'll get slapped up
[scl]and down by my mommy
[scl]again...
[en2]

That's why I said you
[nl2]should stop...[np]
[nl3]I guess we'll just
[scl]have to go look for
[scl]more Luck Rocks.
[en2]

Shall we try getting
[nl2]closer?
[en2]

After checking theblackboard with [Search],you can use an item.[np]
[nl3]Use [Search] to check the
[scl]crates again please.
[en2]

Chirp, chirpy![np]
[nl2]TL:...It's true!
[nl3]I don't know!
[scl]Believe me~!!
[en2]

Let's try a dash with
[nl2]the [BBtn] button.
[en2]

How can we get it, I
[nl2]wonder?
[en2]

Then show it to me.
[nl2]Hurry up and prepare
[nl3]for departure!
[en2]

Why is there a hole
[nl2]here?
[en2]

Let's give it a smack.
[en2]

That's no good!
[nl2]Your timing is off.
[nl3]Let's try again.[np]
[scl]On the count of [Three],
[scl]push the [ABtn] button!
[en1]

Come on!
[nl2]Push the [ABtn] button!
[nl3]Do it!
[en1]

What's this picture?
[en2]

This man was with
[nl2]Indio.
[en2]

This isn't a bad
[nl2]person!
[en2]

Indio had it...
[en2]

Forgot? I'll tell you.
[nl2]Hurry and come here.
[en2]

Come play again.
[nl2]It seems Jim is
[nl3]cooking up a new game.
[en2]

Keep this a secret...
[nl2]But Jim... Has a crush
[nl3]on Miss Gina.
[en2]

[X$79]Mash it to move it!
[nl2]   [C$42]       [C$12][X$7E]
[en1]

[X$79] Push it to move it!
[nl2]        [C$42][X$7E]
[en1]

[X$79]      Mash it!
[nl2]        [C$12][X$7E]
[en1]

What's wrong?
[nl2]Don't quit now!
[en1]

You know, green is my
[nl2]favorite color.[np]
[nl3]Luck Rock yellow is my
[scl]favorite, too.
[en2]

Hehe, that tickles.
[en2]

This red scarf is my
[nl2]trademark.
[nl3]Remember that, okay?
[en2]

There's nothing in my
[nl2]pocket.
[en2]

There's really nothing
[nl2]in there, okay?
[en2]

Why do you keep poking
[nl2]me there?!?!
[en2]

[nl2] Stop it this instant!
[en2]

There are important
[nl2]instructions on that
[nl3]paper.[np]
[scl]Get closer and give it
[scl]a good look.[np]
[scl]When you want to leave
[scl]this screen,[np]
[scl]press [BBtn] or select [Exit]
[scl]and press [ABtn].[np]
[scl]Then the camping can

Haha, look! It came

[en1]

Ooo! Ooo![np]
[nl2]TL: I'm glad you
[nl3]came, Winky.[np]
[scl]Today is your 16th

[scl]Time passes by so

[scl]
[en1]

[nl2]  Listen up, Winky!
[en1]

If you don't "ken"
[nl2]something shown here,
[nl3]point [CrDn] at it.
[en2]

Please clean off the
[nl2]top [Two] windows![np]
[nl3]I can't reach them,
[scl]but I'm sure you kids
[scl]can think of a way.
[en2]

There's a dangerous
[nl2]hole in the floor![np]
[nl3]I need you to cover it
[scl]with a board and
[scl]hammer it into place.
[en2]

I want you to move
[nl2]this table for me![np]
[nl3]Please move it from
[scl]the right side of the
[scl]room to the left side.[np]
[scl]Be careful you don't
[scl]squish yourselves!
[en2]

Thanks to you kids, it
[nl2]turned out alright![np]
[nl3]I hate to ask so much,
[scl]but please take care
[scl]of the rest as well...
[en2]

Bring some other kids
[nl2]over!
[en2]

Once you get to this
[nl2]age, it's hard to
[nl3]shout.[np]
[scl]Come a litle closer.
[en2]

Nice work!
[en2]

There's nothing but
[nl2]clocks inside there.[np]
[nl3]If you'd like, you can
[scl]take the key from
[scl]under the model boat.
[en2]

[SStop]Is the mansion key
[nl2]under here?
[en2]

It's nice to change
[nl2]things up in the room
[nl3]occasionally.
[en2]

It looks heavy.
[en2]

The floor still has
[nl2]that hole in it~![np]
[nl3]It's impossible to
[scl]move it until the
[scl]hole's been fixed.
[en2]

I hope granny doesn't
[nl2]fall in the hole and
[nl3]hurt herself...
[en2]

This would be perfect
[nl2]for covering a hole.
[en2]

We lifted it![np]
[nl2]Move with [CPad] and press
[nl3][ABtn] to drop it.
[en1]

You can't tell without
[nl2]getting closer~!
[en2]

It seems too far to
[nl2]reach!
[en2]

It's caked with dust!
[nl2]Gross!
[en2]

The sun is so bright!
[en2]

[X$79]Let's clean the window!

[en1]

No, it can't be!!
[nl2]Nooo!
[en1]

I'll let you live to

[nl3]Remember this!

Maybe I'll sing a song
[nl2]until the food is
[nl3]ready.[np]
[scl]I'll sing my true

[scl]you won't stand a[np]

[scl]Got it?
[en2]

[X$6A]If you want to learn

[en2]

You can use the [ABtn]

[nl2]the menu, just like
[nl3]the "START" button.[np]
[scl]You can change

The [YBtn] button blows
[nl2]your whistle.[np]
[nl3]It brings your team

The [C$14] button shows

The [RBtn] button changes
[nl2]the leader.
[en1]

The "START" button

[en1]

The "SELECT" button is

The [CPad] is used for
[nl2]moving or selecting
[nl3]command panels.
[en1]

Let's get closer!
[en2]

What could it mean...?
[en2]

I wonder if these
[nl2]numbers mean
[nl3]something important?
[en2]

Maybe it makes sense
[nl2]upside down?
[en2]

The answer is
[nl2]simple...
[en2]

[X$79]Move it! [BBtn] to cancel.
[nl2]        [C$42][X$7E]
[en1]

Su...Sucker?!
[en2]

Enter the numbers with
[nl2][ABtn] and press OK when
[nl3]you're done!
[en2]

Huh!?
[nl2]Something seems off...
[en2]

There must be a switch
[nl2]somewhere!
[en2]

Pii! pii![np]
[nl2]TL: Stay out of our
[nl3]way or you'll get
[scl]hurt!
[en2]

[X$79]Move it. [BBtn] to cancel.
[nl2]        [C$42][X$7E]
[en1]

You found my weak
[nl2]spot![np]
[nl3]Forgive me! I'll never
[scl]prank anyone again!
[en1]

Squeak squeak![np]
[nl2]TL: It's my glorious
[nl3]tail![np]
[scl]I don't care if you
[scl]touch it!
[en2]

Squeak~![np]
[nl2]TL: That tickles!
[nl3]Stop it!
[en2]

There's no way I can
[nl2]lift this... Maybe if
[nl3]we work together?
[en2]

I really want it, but
[nl2]I can't reach it...[np]
[nl3]Maybe there's some way
[scl]to knock it down?
[en2]

Stop it! Please stop!
[nl2]Anywhere but my
[nl3]ears...
[en2]

Well, that's just too
[nl2]much to look past, now
[nl3]isn't it...
[en2]

Now's our chance...
[nl2]Let's run while we
[nl3]still can.
[en2]

Full of nutrition! It
[nl2]might be good for
[nl3]restoring health.[np]
[scl]But you can't eat it
[scl]unless you are
[scl]injured.
[en2]

This is... probably
[nl2]where we are right
[nl3]now!
[en2]

I want to get it, but
[nl2]it's too far away.
[en2]

They have something to
[nl2]do with the guys who
[nl3]took Miss Gina, right?[np]
[scl]
[scl]Let's chase them down
[scl]and find out!
[en2]

You found a Key!
[en1]

"Pirate Ship Lysander"
[nl2]is written on it.[np]
[nl3]The name makes it
[scl]sound a lot cooler
[scl]than it looks.
[en2]

"My son Blue and
[nl2]Blue's mother"
[nl3]...Is written here.
[en2]

There's a painting of
[nl2]a pirate.
[en2]

Fight or flee?...
[nl2]
[nl3]......RUNNNN!!
[en2]

You dummies aren't
[nl2]planning on going
[nl3]after Miss Gina,[np]
[scl]are you?
[scl]You've never even
[scl]been in a fight.[np]
[scl]You probably don't know
[scl]know you can use [C$14] to
[scl]display your health,[np]
[scl]do you?[np]
[scl]If your health drops
[scl]to zero, it's game
[scl]over, man![np]
[scl]Just wait for the
[scl]police to get here.[np]
[scl]Life isn't like a
[scl]video game, you know.
[scl]Later.

[nl2]          2[STink]
[en1]

[nl2]         [Three][SHLow]
[en1]

[nl2][F2] Alright, it's open!
[en1]

I feel like I've seen
[nl2]this "Do not enter"
[nl3]sign before...
[en2]

It seems like the tent
[nl2]we're in right now...
[en2]

Miss Gina must be in
[nl2]the cave to the North!
[en2]

There's a big lake by
[nl2]the cave? Let's use
[nl3]that as a landmark.
[en2]

This picture is awful!
[nl2]Miss Gina is much
[nl3]prettier!
[en2]

What if we put one
[nl2]of us on the left and
[nl3]right, [np]
[scl]and the last guy
[scl]either on top or
[scl]bottom?
[en2]

The pirates took the
[nl2]"rope" and ran off.[np]
[nl3]I don't know where
[scl]they went,[np]
[scl]but they must have
[scl]left footprints in
[scl]the sand!
[en1]

Did you already open
[nl2]the treasure chest in
[nl3]the forest?[np]
[scl]Wasn't there a red
[scl]treasure chest?[np]
[scl]There might be
[scl]something good in it!
[en1]

There's a barking dog
[nl2]under this tree.[np]
[nl3]He looks mean, so
[scl]let's smack him with a
[scl]ball...[np]
[scl]That might teach him
[scl]some manners!
[en1]

Lack of bridge
[nl2]stressing you out?[np]
[nl3]The leaf near the
[scl]river was a bit
[scl]parched, last I saw...[np]
[scl]It's said to become
[scl]quite enormous when
[scl]watered!
[en1]

Did you open the red
[nl2]chest where Winky
[nl3]saved you guys?[np]
[scl]...How unfortunate.
[en1]

Are you using the
[nl2]"Hammer"?[np]
[nl3]Try hammering the peg[np]
[scl]in front of the pipe![np]
[scl]You can move the pipe
[scl]with [TWork].[np]
[scl]Good luck~!
[en1]

[nl2]  Sweet, it opened!
[en1]

[X$6A][SChing]You got Luck Rocks!
[nl2]You have [X$6C] now!
[en1]

It says "Danger ahead!
[nl2]You WILL be injured!"
[nl3]...What should we do?
[en2]

Oh, that's the
[nl2]Colonel's official
[nl3]permission slip![np]
[scl]How did you get it?
[scl]...It's real, right?[np]
[scl]Well, alright, go on
[scl]ahead.
[en1]

Should I be a little
[nl2]more surprised?
[en2]

She was a tomboy with
[nl2]a bad mouth...[np]
[nl3]But I feel a little
[scl]lonely now that she's
[scl]gone.
[en1]

Blub, glub![np]
[nl2]TL: Don't worry about
[nl3]me, I can get back to
[scl]the lake on my own.
[en2]

Hurry and show the
[nl2]"Fishing Hook" to our
[nl3]leader!
[en2]

I see...
[nl2]Just as I thought![np]
[nl3]Oh, sorry, I actually
[scl]don't have a clue.
[en2]

Hurry up and choose
[nl2]"Fishing Hook" from
[nl3]the [Item] panel.[np]
[scl]Use it with the [ABtn]
[scl]button.
[en2]

We need to call the
[nl2]police on the
[nl3]mainland.[np]
[scl]Camp is over now, man.[np]
[scl]Let's go back to the
[scl]mainland together,
[scl]alright?
[en2]

I misjudged you guys![np]
[nl2]But who's the idiot
[nl3]who stole their
[scl]treasure?
[en2]

I wonder what's for
[nl2]lunch...?
[nl3][np]
[scl]...Isn't what I should
[scl]be thinking about
[scl]right now!
[en2]

A small Red Key might
[nl2]fit this keyhole!
[en2]

A small lanky Blue Key
[nl2]might fit this
[nl3]keyhole.
[en2]

A great big Green Key
[nl2]might fit this
[nl3]keyhole!
[en2]

Any color key should
[nl2]fit this keyhole!
[en2]

[F2]Dorothy received the
[nl2]Firewood![np]
[nl3]Err... What?
[en1]

Hey you!
[nl2]Well, if it isn't
[nl3][team] Team![np]
[scl]So you're not dead
[scl]yet!
[en1]

Upon inspecting
[nl2]closer, you see 3
[nl3]of them...
[en2]

[nl2] Why won't this open?
[en2]

Something's wrong.
[nl2]Get on 3 sides of the
[nl3]boulder and hit [TWork]![np]
[scl]It's the only way.
[en1]

Something's not right.
[nl2]Put one on top, two on
[nl3]bottom, and hit [TWork]![np]
[scl]It's the only way.
[en1]

To use teamwork, we've
[nl2]gotta position
[nl3]ourselves better!
[en1]

If you want a tip,
[nl2]choose Luck Rock from
[nl3]the [Item] menu!
[en2]

Hurry back to the
[nl2]ship![np]
[nl3]But if you want more
[scl]Luck Rocks, try a
[scl]house in town.[np]
[scl]Good luck~!
[en1]

Did you find a tent?[np]
[nl2]You should listen to
[nl3]what the adult inside
[scl]says!
[en1]

To continue in the
[nl2]underground cave:[np]
[nl3]You'll need one person
[scl]to operate the
[scl]machine.[np]
[scl]The others can go on
[scl]ahead.[np]
[scl]The switch is next to
[scl]the shutter, so don't
[scl]miss it~!
[en1]

The bully monkey's
[nl2]boss is a gorilla.[np]
[nl3]I bet he'd be happy if
[scl]you recorded a girl
[scl]gorilla's voice...[np]
[scl]And played it back for
[scl]him!
[en1]

Thank you come again~!
[nl2]Received [X$6B] Luck
[nl3]Rocks!
[en1]

[nl2]Who could it be?!
[en2]

It's dangerous, so you
[nl2]really shouldn't go!
[en2]

Our camping island is
[nl2]this way!
[nl3]Wait for us...![np]
[scl]...Miss Gina!!
[en2]

...By the way, who has
[nl2]the tape recorder? [np]
[nl3]I hate to ask, but
[scl]could you give it back
[scl]to me?
[en2]

If you wanna know
[nl2]about the town, why
[nl3]not ask the sheriff?
[en1]

The monster flowers in
[nl2]"Death Lake" can be
[nl3]defeated in two steps.
[scl]First, you kick them
[scl]in their wiggling
[scl]roots...[np]
[scl]Then hit them in the
[scl]flower when it opens
[scl]up~!
[en1]

Did you listen to the
[nl2]request of Indio's
[nl3]daughter to the east?[np]
[scl]Didn't your teacher
[scl]tell you to help out
[scl]those in need~!?
[en1]

There must be a water
[nl2]supply store in town.[np]
[nl3]If you show him that
[scl]picture, I bet he'll
[scl]be surprised!
[en1]

The old lady next door
[nl2]is in quite a fix. Why
[nl3]don't you lend a hand?
[en1]

It seems like the
[nl2]captured Indio had
[nl3]something to say![np]
[scl]...Why not give him a
[scl]listen?
[en1]

I saw the man Indio
[nl2]mentioned east of the
[nl3]lake.
[en1]

Penguins and humans
[nl2]alike are drawn to
[nl3]those like themselves.[np]
[scl]Find penguins who move
[scl]the same way.[np]
[scl]I'm sure they'll make
[scl]good couples.
[en1]

"Hole Digging Machine"
[nl2]Made from old junk![np]
[nl3]Didn't we see some
[scl]parts at the plumber's
[scl]house?
[en1]

Did you try digging 3
[nl2]holes? One hole is
[nl3]blocked by a cow...[np]
[scl]But if you tickle his
[scl]nose, he'll move for
[scl]you.
[en1]

To chase off the
[nl2]Sheriff, you need
[nl3]a Frog![np]
[scl]You can catch a Frog
[scl]with the Fishing Rod.[np]
[scl]But you can't just
[scl]throw it out there![np]
[scl]You have to cast it on
[scl]a leaf, and then watch
[scl]the Frog's reaction.[np]
[scl]Sorry if you already
[scl]knew~!
[en1]

Benson is hiding in an
[nl2]empty house.[np]
[nl3]But you can't get in
[scl]unless the house is
[scl]built with a door.
[en1]

[nl2] That's the only way!
[en2]

Are you checking
[nl2]various things with
[nl3]the [ABtn] button?
[en1]

Just make a time warp!
[en1]

Fortunately, the board
[nl2]was only blocked on
[nl3]top.
[scl]The bottom is still
[scl]open...
[en2]

...Give it a try?
[en2]

Let's get close and
[nl2]check it out.
[en2]

You can't put in any
[nl2]more Luck Rocks while
[nl3]you are playing!
[en2]

It's too small to
[nl2]read. Maybe if we got
[nl3]closer...
[en2]

Shock! The electric
[nl2]man-beast![np]
[nl3]"If you hit electric
[scl]man three times
[scl]in his chest,[np]
[scl]a roulette pops out.[np]
[scl]Hit it once more,

[scl]Luck Rock prize![np]
[scl]It costs 2 Luck
[scl]Rocks to play." [np]
[scl]Wow...

Heheh! Thanks, pal.[np]
[nl2]It's over there, so
[nl3]use it whenever you
[scl]want.
[en1]

You kids are tough
[nl2]customers, not giving
[nl3]me any profit at all.
[en1]

I would have taken
[nl2][X$6B][LuckRock] for that...
[nl3]What a pretty profit!
[en1]

Trade for [X$6B][LuckRock]?[X$6A]
[nl2]    Okay
[nl3]    Can you go lower?[X$68]

But what will you do

By the way...

[scl]What?!
[scl]Only [X$6B]?![np]
[scl]Fine, I'll cut you a

By the way...
[nl2]Do you kids have any

[scl]
[scl]What?
[scl]Not a single one?![np]
[scl]Fine, if you can

[scl]Without a specialist

Okay, I'll stay here
[nl2]and examine these
[nl3]notes.
[en1]

0 Months, 0 Days
[nl2]I found a mysterious
[nl3]Ball.[np]
[scl]It seems to be some
[scl]sort of Crystal.[np]
[scl]We brought it with us
[scl]into the depths of the
[scl]island...[np]
[scl]It was later brought
[scl]into contact with an
[scl]enormous Baobab tree.[np]
[scl]The ancient Baobab has
[scl]long been providing
[scl]vital nutrients to[np]
[scl]plant and animal life
[scl]in the surrounding
[scl]area.[np]
[scl]Since contact with the
[scl]Crystal Ball,[np]
[scl]the Baobab seems to be
[scl]producing an excess
[scl]of oil.[np]
[scl]I hope the Crystal
[scl]Ball will not be
[scl]abused in this way...[np]
[scl][SImprtnt]Lately, strange things
[scl]have been happening on
[scl]this island.[np]
[scl]I'm quite concerned
[scl]about my dog, Socks.[np]
[scl]He's been acting weird
[scl]ever since he wandered
[scl]into the jungle...
[en2]

Did you go further
[nl2]into the island?[np]
[nl3]It seems they harvest
[scl]an oil from the Baobab
[scl]tree a bit farther in.
[en2]

He was studying the
[nl2]parasite's reaction
[nl3]to a certain liquid.[np]
[scl]The strange thing is,
[scl]that liquid is common
[scl]salt water![np]
[scl]No idea why it reacts
[scl]to salt water, but I
[scl]made this for you.
[en1]

[F2]Received Prof.
[nl2]Marlowe's Saltwater
[nl3]Spray![np]
[scl]Yikes, salty!
[en1]

I guess I'll give this
[nl2]to...[np]
[nl3]A clever-seeming lanky
[scl]boy like me...[np]
[scl]Jack!
[en2]

I'll let that lanky
[nl2]fellow, Jack, have it.
[nl3]So come get it.
[en2]

You might be able to
[nl2]crack the riddle.[np]
[nl3]I'll give this to you.
[scl]Use it wisely!
[en1]

What kind of water is
[nl2]it?
[en2]

Salt water... Is it
[nl2]from the ocean?
[en2]

Oh, that made a great
[nl2]photo!
[nl3]Good work, boys.
[en1]

The Luck Rocks are
[nl2]gone!!
[en1]

[nl2]    Hey, open up~!
[en2]

If they raise the
[nl2]lever, the door
[nl3]shuts...
[en2]

Hey~,when this boat's
[nl2]a-rockin' don't come
[nl3]a-knockin'!
[en2]

[F2]You put Salt Water in
[nl2]the Water Bottle!
[en1]

[nl2]  Eh? What's this...?
[nl3][np]
[scl]A key!!...
[scl]How do we get it...?
[scl][np]
[scl]Hmm...
[scl]Should we use an item?
[en2]

[SStop]Okay, now we can pull
[nl2]the key out through
[nl3]his mouth...[np]
[scl]Maybe...?
[en1]

[X$79]  Aim and pull!
[nl2]   [C$42]       [C$12][X$7E]
[en1]

[F2]You got the... *burp*
[nl2]Cave Key.[np]
[nl3]It's a little acidic.
[en1]

Is this the key to the
[nl2]cave?
[en2]

Take this.
[nl2]Use it wisely!
[en1]

The plant must have
[nl2]assumed human form!
[nl3]You have to find it![np]
[scl]Will you help me?[X$6A]
[scl]    Okay
[scl]    Noooo[X$68]
[en1]

Ooh, what great music![np]
[nl2]I love to drink while
[nl3]listening to this
[scl]song.[np]
[scl]Whaddaya say kids,
[scl]you wanna drink up,
[scl]too?[np]
[scl]This heavy drink will
[scl]put some hair on your
[scl]chests!
[en1]

If you don't hurry up,
[nl2]it'll get dark out~.
[en2]

[F2]Fudge! I lost...
[nl2]Fine, take this Luck
[nl3]Rock!
[en1]

I just gots to dance!
[en2]

Kii, kii! Kii![np]
[nl2]TL: Get out!
[nl3]Get out of our home!
[en2]

Kii, kii! Kii![np]
[nl2]TL: Get out!
[nl3]Get out of our home!
[en2]

You do?
[nl2]You seem pretty smart!
[nl3]Use this wisely!
[en1]

You?
[nl2]I don't think so.
[nl3]Hah!
[en2]

It used to be a cute
[nl2]little plant like
[nl3]this.
[en2]

...It looks like a
[nl2]map.[np]
[nl3]The numbers must be...
[scl]Floor numbers?
[scl]...There are two.
[en2]

At first I didn't
[nl2]wish...
[en2]

There are lots of
[nl2]painful seeming
[nl3]thorns.
[en2]

Don't you have
[nl2]something that would
[nl3]help?
[en2]

Don't you have
[nl2]goosebumps?!
[en2]

For some reason...
[nl2]I want to punch it.
[en2]

Haha, I'm glad I
[nl2]secretly brought these
[nl3]swimming goggles![np]
[scl]I'm the only one who
[scl]can enjoy this truly
[scl]amazing experience.[np]
[scl]Sorry, but I'm going
[scl]to go diving again
[scl]now...
[en1]

I lost my goggles...
[nl2]...I guess I'll just
[nl3]watch them fish.
[en1]

[nl2]...My... My goggles!
[en2]

Did you know when you
[nl2]want to look at things
[nl3]that are far away,[np]
[scl]you can press [ABtn] and
[scl]move the [CrDn] to what
[scl]you want to check,[np]
[scl]and then press [ABtn] to
[scl]check it?
[en2]

I'm so hungry~...
[nl2]Feed me~...[np]
[nl3]Come on, don't just
[scl]stand there!
[en2]

I'm so hungry~...
[nl2]Feed me~...[np]
[nl3]One more time!
[en2]

[team] Team, are you
[nl2]using [TWork]?
[en2]

I'm so hungry, I think
[nl2]I'll die here.
[en2]

Humming!
[nl2]Hmmm~... Hmm~... Hum~!
[en2]

I'm... I'm so happy.
[en2]

I'm... I'm so happy~.
[nl2]Heheh~...
[en2]

Those shoes are pretty
[nl2]good.[np]
[nl3]So try kicking lots of
[scl]stuff with them.
[en2]

Want a whiff?
[en2]

If you're boys, why
[nl2]don't you explore the
[nl3]island a little?[np]
[scl]At least get out of
[scl]here!
[en2]

...What does this star
[nl2]mark mean?[np]
[nl3]Is something special
[scl]here?
[en2]

...This seems to
[nl2]indicate where we
[nl3]are...
[en2]

Stop whining and go
[nl2]look for her!
[en2]

What?... You guys look
[nl2]awfully guilty!
[nl3]Well, whatever...[np]
[scl]Until Miss Gina gets
[scl]back,[np]
[scl]go in the tent and
[scl]listen to the egghead's
[scl]boring lecture.
[en1]

Bring the other kids
[nl2]here.
[en2]

Wait...
[nl2]Don't tell me![np]
[nl3]You guys are seriously
[scl]going after Miss Gina,
[scl]aren't you?...[np]
[scl]
[scl]..................
[scl][np]
[scl]Okay, well, if you
[scl]are, at least take
[scl]these walkie-talkies.
[en1]

When your team is too
[nl2]far to hear your
[nl3]whistle,[np]
[scl]equip this and use the
[scl][BBtn] button.
[en1]

You guys should just
[nl2]call the mainland.[np]
[nl3]Might as well wait for
[scl]the adults to handle
[scl]the situation.
[en2]

Kii-kii!![np]
[nl2]TL: Are you with
[nl3]them!?[np]
[scl]You'll never take me
[scl]alive!!
[en1]

Chirpoo.[np]
[nl2]TL: Hey, wait!!
[en1]

Winky, are you
[nl2]seriously giving those
[nl3]keys to these kids?
[en1]

Oooki aah![np]
[nl2]TL: Yes, I believe
[nl3]they are all good
[scl]kids.
[en1]

Mee myuu.[np]
[nl2]TL: Fine, come over
[nl3]here and take my coat.
[en2]

Be sure you record
[nl2]everything you've done
[nl3]in the "Journal."[np]
[scl]If you forget, and get
[scl]into a mess, don't say
[scl]I didn't warn you.
[en2]

If you look closely,
[nl2]it might be a
[nl3]switch...
[en2]

Maybe if you put fuel
[nl2]in here, the ship will
[nl3]move...
[en2]

It's full of soot.
[nl2]*cough cough*
[en2]

You only have [X$6B] LR.
[nl2]It isn't enough~.
[en2]

You have [X$6B] Luck
[nl2]Rocks!
[en1]

You have [X$6B] Rocks
[nl2]    Put 'em in!
[nl3]    Not just yet.[X$68]
[en1]

Luck Rocks sure are
[nl2]strange stones~.
[en2]

It seems like
[nl2]something is hidden
[nl3]beneath this boulder.
[en2]

We've lifted countless
[nl2]boulders already,
[nl3]Hohoho...
[en1]

Ick! An ant was under
[nl2]there!
[en1]

Great! There's a hole
[nl2]that leads deeper.
[en1]

Shaka. Shakaka![np]
[nl2]TL: If you drag your
[nl3]feet, I'll catch you!
[en2]

.....?![np]
[nl2]I think I can hear a
[nl3]voice from under this
[scl]boulder.[np]
[scl]Was it my imagination?
[en2]

...What the heck?!
[en1]

...Oh gosh, what
[nl2]should we do?[np]
[nl3]I wonder if that
[scl]medicine will work on
[scl]Hassan...?
[en2]

Oh man, it won't work
[nl2]on a non-soldier?[np]
[nl3]...Let's use the whole
[scl]bottle!
[en1]

......Phew.
[nl2]You saved me.[np]
[nl3]I was about to be
[scl]squished into squid
[scl]paste![np]
[scl]Thank you so much.[np]
[scl]....!!
[scl]Oh no, what happened
[scl]to the princess?!
[en1]

Agh, my body won't
[nl2]move.[np]
[nl3]Getting old is just 
[scl]awful...
[en1]

[F2]Received Hassan's
[nl2]great invention, the
[nl3]Buster Cannon![np]
[scl]...I wonder how it
[scl]works.
[en1]

This cannon has 10
[nl2]times the power of the
[nl3]regular Ant Buster![np]
[scl]It should be able to
[scl]defeat the "Ant
[scl]Queen."[np]
[scl]When you face her,
[scl]press the [ABtn] button to
[scl]lock in the movement.[np]
[scl]Use it with [Item]![np]
[scl]My prayers go with
[scl]you.
[en1]

Shaka, shakaka![np]
[nl2]TL: If you want to
[nl3]beat us,[np]
[scl]you'd better bring some
[scl]ocean water!
[en2]

Oh, my tape recorder!
[nl2]Thanks.
[en1]

[F2]You sure are nice
[nl2]children![np]
[nl3]I'm sure things will
[scl]start going your way.
[en1]

But... Now we can't
[nl2]move forward.
[nl3]What do we do?!
[en2]

It looks too heavy to
[nl2]move, and if we push
[nl3]it inside...[np]
[scl]We still can't get in.
[scl]What should we do...?
[en2]

Yeah!
[nl2]Now we can keep going!
[nl3]Let's find Polly!
[en1]

It seems there is
[nl2]still a room below.
[en2]

Let's save this until
[nl2]we face the Queen.
[en1]

Let's get closer and
[nl2]check it out.
[en2]

Want to play a fun
[nl2]game? Hehehe...
[nl3]Come a little closer.
[en2]

If you want to play,
[nl2]choose Luck Rock from
[nl3]the [Item] menu!
[en2]

Alright, I have taken
[nl2]1 Luck Rock.[np]
[nl3]Look carefully at the
[scl]moving panels before
[scl]you kick!
[en1]

...Where were you
[nl2]looking?!
[nl3]You suck so bad~![np]
[scl]Want to try again?
[en1]

Dummy. Did you see
[nl2]those catching skills?
[nl3]...You're so unlucky![np]
[scl]Try again?
[en1]

If you don't
[nl2]concentrate, you can't
[nl3]hit the middle!
[en2]

Oh! You found my "Kick
[nl2]Slots" machine.
[nl3]Cool, right?
[en2]

Oh! You found my "Ball
[nl2]Grabber" machine.
[nl3]Cool, right?
[en2]

Oh! You found my
[nl2]"Defensive Formation"
[nl3]machine. Cool, right?
[en2]

Hurry and kick it.
[en2]

One month's time.
[en1]

When there's only [num]
[nl2]Luck Rock.
[en1]

Did you run into
[nl2]Hassan?[np]
[nl3]To defeat the Ant
[scl]Queen, you need his
[scl]Buster Cannon!
[en2]

You have to wait for
[nl2]an opening to use your
[nl3]Buster Cannon.[np]
[scl]Find your courage and
[scl]aim!
[en2]

...Dang-![np]
[nl2]There's nothing to do
[nl3]now but wait for
[scl]death....
[en2]

Let's try out that
[nl2]thing Hassan gave us.
[en2]

If you get hit, your
[nl2]controls are reversed!
[en2]

[CPad] aim!     [ABtn] fire!
[nl2]   [C$42]       [C$12][X$7E]
[en1]

Fiiiirrrre!!!!
[en1]

Right on! Direct hit!
[en1]

Ah nuts... We've got to
[nl2]aim better!
[en1]

[X$79]Charge up with [C$38]!![X$78]
[en1]

...Yikes!
[nl2]It's coming for us!!
[en1]

You guys...
[nl2]
[nl3][np]
[scl]
[scl]      Thanks....
[scl]
[en1]

The truth is...
[nl2]I wasn't even tied up.
[nl3]See...?
[en1]

I was scared of the
[nl2]Queen...[np]
[nl3]But I also believed
[scl]that you would come to
[scl]my rescue...[np]
[scl][SP$001D]Yeah, right!
[scl]As if I would depend
[scl]on you guys![np]
[scl]I'm going back to the
[scl]castle now.
[en1]

For generations, the
[nl2]monkeys of this island
[nl3]have guarded a secret.[np]
[scl]Today, this great
[scl]responsibility shall
[scl]be passed on to you.
[en1]

[F2]Winky received the
[nl2]"Three Keys" from the
[nl3]Elder!
[en1]

Have you seen the
[nl2]ancient ship on this
[nl3]island?[np]
[scl]That ship and these
[scl]keys have a strong
[scl]connection...
[en1]

These keys unlock the
[nl2]secret of this island.
[nl3]But more than that--[np]
[scl]They have the power to
[scl]change the lives of
[scl]those who hold them.[np]
[scl]Winky, you must find
[scl]humans who are worthy
[scl]of the keys.
[en1]

Ah yes, {Pluck}?
[nl2]Are you here, Pluck?
[en1]

Pluck will aid you in
[nl2]your task.[np]
[nl3]You two must work
[scl]together to protect
[scl]the keys.
[en1]

Oookii! Oookii![np]
[nl2]TL: Bad news, Elder!
[nl3]Humans have come to
[scl]capture us!
[en1]

You must escape, 
[nl2]Elder!
[en1]

Oookii! Oookikikikii!![np]
[nl2]TL: They've come for
[nl3]the keys![np]
[scl]Winky, Pluck, I'm
[scl]counting on you!
[scl]
[en1]

Piropii. Pirororoo![np]
[nl2]TL: What are you
[nl3]doing?[np]
[scl]Hurry, you need
[scl]to get out of here,
[scl]too![np]
[scl]Gosh, what a dunce.
[en1]

Did the country really
[nl2]return to its previous
[nl3]size?[np]
[scl]That's a lot to
[scl]swallow...
[en2]

This country returned
[nl2]to normal size, right?[np]
[nl3]I'm going to go check
[scl]it out.
[en1]

...Come over here, I
[nl2]have something to tell
[nl3]you.
[en2]

Thanks to you guys, I
[nl2]saw something cool!
[nl3]Here's a secret prize.
[en1]

[F2]You received Luck
[nl2]Rocks from the King![np]
[nl3]He gave you [Five][Zero]
[scl]pieces of 'em!! Wow!
[en1]

Can you go see Polly
[nl2]before you leave?[np]
[nl3]She puts on a tough
[scl]face, but she's a bit
[scl]lonely on the inside.
[en2]

Polly doesn't really
[nl2]take after her mom...[np]
[nl3]Maybe this's what it
[scl]means to be an adult?[np]
[scl]Yeah... I guess this
[scl]is growing up.
[en2]

The king told me I
[nl2]have to draw Polly
[nl3]next.[np]
[scl]But without a model,
[scl]I can't do it.
[en2]

[F2]Perfect![np]
[nl2]You've mastered my
[nl3]drawing technique!
[en2]

Customers stopped
[nl2]coming around thanks
[nl3]to the "Blue Things."[np]
[scl]Thanks to the ant
[scl]monsters, business is
[scl]in the pits.
[en2]

Oh, if you ever stay
[nl2]in an inn--[np]
[nl3]When you start the
[scl]game, choose "start
[scl]from inn."[np]
[scl]You can't stay in an
[scl]inn while you're
[scl]playing.
[en2]

I have something to
[nl2]tell you, so come
[nl3]closer!
[en2]

Thank you so much!![np]
[nl2]Now the kingdom can
[nl3]become a happy place
[scl]again.[np]
[scl]...Oh, leaving
[scl]already?
[scl]Did you talk to Polly?[np]
[scl]I haven't seen her
[scl]lately...[np]
[scl]You're welcome to
[scl]return whenever you
[scl]like.
[en2]

It looks like a bug
[nl2]carrying a round
[nl3]thing...[np]
[scl]Is that round thing
[scl]an eagle egg?
[en2]

Two small bugs are
[nl2]rolling an egg.
[en2]

Shaka. Shaka. Shakaka.[np] 
[nl2]TL: Just when we got
[nl3]rid of that eagle,[np]
[scl]it's too heavy and we
[scl]can't move it.
[en2]

Shaka. Shaka. Shakaka.[np]
[nl2]TL: We're eggroll-ers.[np]
[nl3]If we stopped rolling,
[scl]we'd be just plain old
[scl]bugs.
[en2]

So these guys were the
[nl2]thieves.[np]
[nl3]...Oh, we can replace
[scl]that ball with this
[scl]egg![np]
[scl]Watch the movements
[scl]carefully and press [ABtn]
[scl]to take the egg.[np]
[scl]Press [BBtn] to cancel.
[en1]

[SP$0127]Take these 3 keys.
[en1]

Crap...
[nl2]They're moving too
[nl3]much~!
[en1]

[F2]You received the
[nl2]real Eagle Egg![np]
[nl3]Let's exchange it for
[scl]the ball.
[en1]

Polly has requested
[nl2]your presence at the
[nl3]castle.[np]
[scl]It must be for some
[scl]kind of "reward."
[en2]

Your battle with the
[nl2]"Queen" will be told
[nl3]in stories for[np]
[scl]generations.
[en2]

Everyone's waiting for
[nl2]you at the castle.
[nl3]Hurry up and see them.
[en2]

Regrettably, there are
[nl2]still some who have
[nl3]not returned from the[np]
[scl]"Blue Things" nest.
[scl]Could they not have
[scl]been saved?
[en2]

At least now, the
[nl2]"Blue Things" will
[nl3]stop attacking this[np]
[scl]country. Now, if the
[scl]monsters in the forest
[scl]would shrink a[np]
[scl]little...
[en2]

But we can't let our
[nl2]guard down yet. There
[nl3]are still giant[np]
[scl]monsters out there.
[scl]Stay frosty.
[en2]

The Blue Things'
[nl2]"Queen" was defeated.[np]
[nl3]But there are still
[scl]giant monsters in the
[scl]forest.[np]
[scl]We must be careful.
[en2]

You guys might get a
[nl2]nice salary out of
[nl3]this.
[en2]

I should have spent
[nl2]more time honing my
[nl3]battle skills.[np]
[scl]Though, it's too late
[scl]for that now.
[en2]

I just heard from Lady
[nl2]Polly...[np]
[nl3]It's a pretty good
[scl]name, I guess.
[en2]

Thank you for saving
[nl2]all the soldiers.[np]
[nl3]Everyone is very
[scl]grateful to you.
[en2]

Well, not every
[nl2]soldier made it back.[np]
[nl3]But in that situation,
[scl]I guess safety was
[scl]impossible...[np]
[scl]Pray for their souls.
[en2]

The king is waiting
[nl2]for you.
[nl3]Hurry and see him.
[en2]

I think I'll name my
[nl2]army [team] army.[np]
[nl3]...Yeah, that sounds
[scl]good.
[en2]

I shudder to remember
[nl2]my thoughts of dying
[nl3]in there...[np]
[scl]...What a dark,
[scl]terrible place.
[en2]

Hassan requested that
[nl2]I give you gifts to
[nl3]your heart's content.
[en2]

I bet Polly thinks
[nl2]much better of you
[nl3]now.[np]
[scl]Why don't you go see
[scl]her?
[en2]

The king is also very
[nl2]pleased.
[nl3]Go see him.
[en2]

Come with me, the king
[nl2]is waiting for you
[nl3]behind the castle.
[en1]

As thanks for saving
[nl2]Polly, you may enter
[nl3]my secret garden.[np]
[scl]What do you think?[np]
[scl]I tried to combine
[scl]East and West in this
[scl]rock garden.
[en2]

...Hmm?...
[nl2]...This garden?...[np]
[nl3]It's my first time
[scl]seeing it as well...[np]
[scl]...Doesn't the ball in
[scl]the middle give you
[scl]the willies?
[en2]

Caesar said you kids
[nl2]did a good job...[np] 
[nl3]And he said not to
[scl]forget how to paint.
[en2]

Could it be... 
[nl2]Is it possible!?[np]
[nl3]We need to talk to
[scl]Hassan.
[en2]

You wish to consult
[nl2]with me?
[nl3]Then come closer.
[en2]

...Yes... 
[nl2]It's possible[np].
[nl3]Yes, that explains
[scl]everything.[np]
[scl]...I see, it's making
[scl]us tiny dwarves!?[np]
[scl]And...
[scl]That ball is the cause of
[scl]everything!?[np]
[scl]Wait here a moment.
[en1]

...Actually...
[nl2]How do I say this...[np]
[nl3]The king has stated
[scl]that you boys may take
[scl]the ball as a prize.[np]
[scl]It might seem like it's
[scl]for our convenience...[np]
[scl]But please help us get
[scl]rid of it.
[en1]

That ball was found in
[nl2]the forest before the
[nl3]kingdom shrank.[np]
[scl]...Come to think of
[scl]it...[np]
[scl]It wasn't all that big
[scl]to begin with!
[en2]

We could float it into
[nl2]the sky and let the
[nl3]wind carry it![np]
[scl] ....Psyche! Isn't it
[scl]obvious?[np]
[scl]Something that heavy
[scl]won't float.
[en2]

FIX ME
[nl2]I wonder how that
[nl3]happened...
[en2]

What if you lifted it
[nl2]with teamwork?[np]
[nl3]But the ship is
[scl]awfully far, isn't
[scl]it...
[en2]

We have to do
[nl2]something right away!
[en2]

...That's right!![np]
[nl2]The giant eagle that
[nl3]attacked us was
[scl]looking for an egg![np]
[scl]If we painted this
[scl]ball the same pattern
[scl]as an egg...[np]
[scl]Maybe the eagle would
[scl]take it away for us![np]
[scl]Will you try it?
[scl]    Yeah, we will.
[scl]    I can't remember...[X$68]
[en1]

You need to go to the
[nl2]eagle's nest and look
[nl3]at his eggs! Hurry!
[en1]

Now let's go back to
[nl2]the ball and paint it
[nl3]like the eggs!
[en2]

Let's get close and
[nl2]give it a try.
[en2]

...I wonder if this
[nl2]will work...
[nl3]Won't hurt to try.
[en2]

Are you ready?[np]
[nl2]I'm not sure if this
[nl3]will work, but it's our
[scl]best shot.[np]
[scl]What'll you do?[X$6A]
[scl]    We'll try it.
[scl]    I don't remember...[X$68]
[en1]

[SStop]Let's start.
[nl2]Remember Caesar's
[nl3]books.[np]
[scl]What color is first?[X$6A][np]
[scl]
[scl]    Deon - Red
[scl]    Jack - Blue
[scl]    Max  - Green[X$6E]
[en1]

Who is next?
[nl2]    Deon - Red
[nl3]    Jack - Blue[X$68]
[en1]

Who is next?
[nl2]    Deon - Red
[nl3]    Max  - Green[X$68]
[en1]

Who is next?
[nl2]    Jack - Blue
[nl3]    Max  - Green[X$68]
[en1]

...It seems like the
[nl2]eagle won't come.[np]
[nl3]Maybe the pattern is
[scl]wrong?[np]
[scl]Why don't you go look
[scl]at the eggs again.
[en1]

Perhaps you could read
[nl2]Caesar's book "How to
[nl3]Paint."[np]
[scl]You'll find it in the
[scl]castle archives.
[en2]

[SAwe]What's wrong?
[nl2]Just calm down, focus,
[nl3]and look at the egg.[np]
[scl]Okay?
[en1]

[SMonkey2]Caww! Caaaw! Caw![np]
[nl2]TL: I found it!!!
[nl3]My egg!!
[en1]

[SMonkey2]Caw! Caw. Caw.[np]
[nl2]TL: My poor little
[nl3]egg!
[scl]Let's go home~.
[en1]

Hurray! The eagle took
[nl2]the ball away![np]
[nl3]Hurry to the nest and
[scl]take it back!
[en1]

...Oh, right.[np]
[nl2]No one is allowed to
[nl3]use the electric
[scl]switch anymore.[np]
[scl]It seems broken.
[en2]

Hey, this game is only
[nl2]for someone who knows
[nl3]how to kick.
[en2]

...Huh?... You don't
[nl2]have any Luck Rocks
[nl3]left, chump. ... Fine, I'll[np]
[scl]take pity on you and
[scl]give you [num] Luck
[scl]Rock. You should quit[np]
[scl]while you're ahead.
[en1]

Received [num] Luck Rock
[nl2]from Jam.[np]
[nl3]...Jam might be nicer
[scl]than Jim!
[en1]

Okay, you got lucky
[nl2]that time.
[nl3]Try again?[np]
[scl]Don't run out on me,
[scl]now.
[en1]

[X$6A]Received [X$6B] Luck Rocks.
[en1]

Listen to Winky.[np]
[nl2]He's not usually very
[nl3]useful...[np]
[scl]But this time his
[scl]instincts seem spot
[scl]on.
[en2]

Ooo ooo![np]
[nl2]TL: Make Indio and
[nl3]daughter happy.[np]
[scl]Be careful! Bye-bye.
[en2]

Ooo ooo kii![np]
[nl2]TL: Find man in charge
[nl3]on island.[np]
[scl]He somewhere cramped.[np]
[scl]Poor guy.
[en2]

Ooo ooo aah![np]
[nl2]TL: Little king in
[nl3]distress.[np]
[scl]Tell him why so small.
[en2]

Ooo ooo!
[nl2]TL:
[en2]

Which one?
[nl2]Show me!
[en2]

Great, let's go find
[nl2]the last [Two] crystal
[nl3]balls.[np]
[scl]After the ship leaves,
[scl]we won't be able to
[scl]return to this island.[np]
[scl]So make sure you've
[scl]done everything you
[scl]want to do here.[np]
[scl]When you're ready,
[scl]start her up!
[en2]

Great, let's go find
[nl2]the last Crystal Ball.[np]
[nl3]Do you have enough
[scl]Luck Rocks?[np]
[scl]You can take it from
[scl]here!
[en2]

Okay, now everything
[nl2]is in order.[np]
[nl3]Let's head back to the
[scl]island![np]
[scl]...........?!
[en2]

Hurry and show Pluck!
[en2]

We've arrived at an
[nl2]island!
[en1]

Ooo! Kii![np]
[nl2]TL: Move ship to
[nl3]save teacher!
[scl]Hurry! Hurry!
[en1]

[SP$033A]Chirpoo![np]
[nl2]TL: Come on, Winky,
[nl3]you have to explain
[scl]from the beginning.
[en1]

The door in the cave
[nl2]can't be opened using
[nl3]only one Crystal Ball.
[en1]

In order to open the
[nl2]door, you need [Three]
[nl3]more Crystal Balls.[np]
[scl]Don't blame me, it's
[scl]the first puzzle left
[scl]by Captain Maverick.[np]
[scl]We can use this ship
[scl]to track down the
[scl]other [Three] balls.[np]
[scl]It's the only way to
[scl]save your teacher.[np]
[scl]Otherwise, you'll end
[scl]up like those pirates.[np]
[scl]So, how about it?
[scl]Do you understand?[np]
[scl]    Yes.
[scl]    No.[X$68]
[en1]

Don't you understand
[nl2]anything~?[np]
[nl3]Seriously, it's like
[scl]there are FOUR
[scl]Winkys before me!
[en1]

Let me see the Crystal
[nl2]Ball.[np]
[nl3]It should show the
[scl]position of the next
[scl]Crystal Ball...[np]
[scl]Sorta like a compass.
[en1]

Now, you need to put
[nl2][X$6B] Luck Rocks in the
[nl3]furnace below deck.[np]
[scl]Then pull the giant
[scl]lever.
[en2]

It looks like you've
[nl2]filled the furnace
[nl3]below deck.[np]
[scl]Now, pull the lever.
[en2]

After you put in the
[nl2]Luck Rocks, pull the
[nl3]lever.
[en2]

Fill furnace down
[nl2]stairs.
[nl3]Hurry! Hurry!
[en2]

After you get the ship
[nl2]moving, you have to
[nl3]hold the wheel steady.[np]
[scl]Otherwise, we'll never
[scl]reach the next island.
[en2]

We all in this
[nl2]together, friends.
[nl3]Friends!
[en2]

Hold her steady!
[en2]

Why don't you go relax
[nl2]outside until we reach
[nl3]the next island?
[en2]

Know what next?
[nl2]Oooooooo-Ahhhh!
[nl3]What next? What next??
[en2]

The ship is listing
[nl2]out of control...[np]
[nl3]When the compass is
[scl]pointing straight
[scl]ahead,[np]
[scl]that's when you'll need
[scl]to lock in the course.[np]
[scl]Take hold of the helm!
[en2]

[X$79]  Press to lock on.
[nl2]        [C$12][X$7E]
[en1]

The island with the
[nl2]next Crystal Ball must
[nl3]be this way.
[en2]

It's locked on.
[en2]

It looks like we can
[nl2]just barely reach it.
[en2]

Pull the lever!
[en2]

Do together!
[nl2]Hurry! Hurry!
[en2]

[SMonkey2]Kweh! Caaaaaw![np]
[nl2]TL: I'll never leave
[nl3]my eggs again!
[en2]

...This is a real
[nl2]egg...
[en1]

[SMonkey2]Kweh?! Caaw?![np]
[nl2]TL: What's going on?
[nl3]...There are 4 eggs?
[en1]

[SMonkey2]Caaw? Kweh!![np]
[nl2]TL: What's this?
[nl3]This one isn't mine!!
[en1]

[SMonkey2]Caaw. Kweh![np]
[nl2]TL: Wow, that almost
[nl3]fooled me.[np]
[scl]I'm taking my egg back!
[en1]

[SMonkey2]Caaw. Kweh~.[np]
[nl2]TL: Stay away from my
[nl3]eggs.
[en2]

Let's get back to the
[nl2]ship right away.
[en2]

What are you doing?
[nl2]Hurry up and get over
[nl3]here.
[en2]

Did you put the Luck
[nl2]Rocks in the furnace?[np]
[nl3]If you need more, I'll
[scl]give you mine.[np]
[scl]Need an assist?
[scl]    Yes, please.
[scl]    I don't need you![X$68]
[en1]

Well, fine then!
[nl2]Go below deck and
[nl3]prepare for departure![np]
[scl]...Imbecile.
[en2]

You guys have [X$6C]
[nl2]Luck Rocks, so you
[nl3]need [X$6B] more.[np]
[scl]Here you are.
[en1]

...Received [X$6B] Luck
[nl2]Rocks from Polly!
[en1]

You guys are lazy
[nl2]piggies![np]
[nl3]Hurry up and get down
[scl]below!
[en1]

Did you already fill
[nl2]the furnace?[np]
[nl3]Hurry up if you
[scl]haven't...[np]
[scl]You don't have any time
[scl]to waste, do you?!
[en2]

[SP$0017]
[nl2]...Just kidding.
[nl3]I'm not going.[np]
[scl]I really want to go
[scl]with you all...[np]
[scl]But I can't leave my
[scl]father alone.[np]
[scl]My journey ends here.
[en1]

Oookii, oookii-kii![np]
[nl2]TL: That girl--
[nl3]Very scary...
[en2]

Chirpy chirpoo.[np]
[nl2]TL: I wonder if she
[nl3]still wants to travel
[scl]with us.
[en2]

...There are two polka
[nl2]dot eggs.[np]
[nl3]It looks like another
[scl]egg would fit in the
[scl]nest.
[en2]

I wonder if whoever
[nl2]sailed this ship ran
[nl3]it alone?
[en2]

It looks like it would
[nl2]take a lot of power to
[nl3]move this...
[en2]

The ship's captain sat
[nl2]here, I guess.
[en2]

Maybe those guys who
[nl2]kidnapped Miss Gina
[nl3]would know?
[en2]

Alright, let's flip
[nl2]this one.
[en1]

Chirp chirpy![np]
[nl2]TL: Your timing was
[nl3]off![np]
[scl]Lock it in when it
[scl]changes color, ya'
[scl]deadweight~!
[en1]

Chirpy chirpy.[np]
[nl2]TL: Good job!
[nl3]Now we can go to the
[scl]next island!
[en1]

The island I just came
[nl2]from was crazy~![np]
[nl3]They were having some
[scl]horrible drought.[np]
[scl]The people and fields
[scl]were just dry as dust.[np]
[scl]It used to be such a
[scl]nice place...[np]
[scl]Oh, I've talked your
[scl]ears right off,
[scl]haven't I.[np]
[scl]Toodleloo~!
[en1]

I hear a lot of my
[nl2]friends out there...
[en2]

Something coming...
[en2]

[SMonkey2]Caww! Caaw![np]
[nl2]TL: A storm's brewin'!
[nl3]Take shelter!
[en2]

Look outside![np]
[nl2]You have to lock the
[nl3]wheel before we're
[scl]swept away!
[en2]

Lock broken!
[nl2]Fix! Fix!
[en2]

It's not even winter.
[en2]

Cold! Cold!
[en2]

It has to be a little
[nl2]cold!
[en2]

Excuse me...?[np]
[nl2]You want to set me up
[nl3]with a girl who's "just
[scl]my type"?![np]
[scl]
[scl]
[scl]I'm married, you know!
[en2]

Do something~!!
[en2]

Something block path!
[en2]

Maybe this is blocking
[nl2]our path?
[en2]

Ooo ooo![np]
[nl2]TL: Come here!
[nl3]Fast! Fast!
[en2]

We're searching this
[nl2]island for some lost
[nl3]kids![np]
[scl]Do you know anything
[scl]about them?[np]
[scl]They were called
[scl][team] Team.[np]
[scl]And one of them had
[scl]a hat like that...[np]
[scl]...Hey?...
[scl]You kids aren't...?
[en2]

We're back at the
[nl2]first island.
[en2]

[SP$0010]...I wonder how Polly
[nl2]is doing.
[en2]

...It seems like Polly
[nl2]might jump out at any
[nl3]moment.
[en2]

This robot and this
[nl2]whole island are
[nl3]pretty strange.[np]
[scl]I have a weird
[scl]feeling.[np]
[scl]And we can't find those
[scl]missing kids.
[en2]

It seems like stuff
[nl2]went to pot after we
[nl3]left...
[en2]

...There's no response.
[nl2]...It must be broken.
[en2]

...It seems like
[nl2]someone was growing
[nl3]tomatoes here.[np]
[scl]I wonder if it's
[scl]connected to this case
[scl]somehow.
[en2]

There's a path through
[nl2]here.[np]
[nl3]It seems to lead to
[scl]the opposite side of
[scl]the island...[np]
[scl]But it's a pretty old
[scl]road...
[en2]

The pipe is connected
[nl2]to the lake up
[nl3]there...[np]
[scl]When we came here, all
[scl]the pipes were
[scl]connected.[np]
[scl]But that'd make the
[scl]lake water run down
[scl]to the ocean.[np]
[scl]Why would someone do
[scl]that?
[en2]

So you understand?
[nl2]Then don't get in the
[nl3]way of a man at work.
[en2]

This whole thing must
[nl2]be Blue's doing.[np]
[nl3]His cohorts are
[scl]keeping their mouths
[scl]shut, though.
[en2]

So you want to go
[nl2]through here?[np]
[nl3]You're need gonna need
[scl]the colonel's express
[scl]permission.
[en2]

Hurry up and put
[nl2][X$6B] Luck Rocks in
[nl3]the furnace below!!
[en2]

Hurry and save Miss
[nl2]Gina!
[en2]

Push the lever!
[nl2]We have to save Miss
[nl3]Gina!
[en2]

We can handle things
[nl2]until we reach the
[nl3]island.[np]
[scl]Why don'cha go outside
[scl]and get some fresh
[scl]air, [team] Team?
[en2]

We can handle things
[nl2]until the next island!
[en2]

[team] Team!
[nl2]Pull the lever!!
[en2]

Team work!
[en2]

It seems that Pluck is
[nl2]on this ship, isn't he?
[nl3][np]
[scl]Tell him I'll visit him
[scl]again sometime.
[scl]        ...Until then!
[en1]

Hurry. Push the lever!
[en2]

Fugo. Fugo. Fugogo.[np]
[nl2]TL: If you have
[nl3]something to say, come
[scl]a little closer.[np]
[scl]I won't bite...
[en2]

...Hey... Wasn't our
[nl2]teacher with you?[np]
[nl3]...Who?...
[scl]Miss Gina, duh!![np]
[scl]Don't make me say lame
[scl]stuff like that!
[en2]

By the way...
[nl2]What happened to Miss
[nl3]Gina?[np]
[scl]Wasn't she with you?[np]
[scl]...Is she really
[scl]lost?!
[en2]

Oh, you guys are okay.
[nl2]But...
[nl3]What about Miss Gina?[np]
[scl]Wasn't she with you?[np]
[scl]What?
[scl]You want to go in the
[scl]cave ahead?[np]
[scl]...No way, it's
[scl]dangerous in there.[np]
[scl]I can't let you kids go
[scl]in there all alone.
[en2]

By the way... 
[nl2]What happened to Miss
[nl3]Gina?[np]
[scl]Wasn't she with you?[np]
[scl]...She's actually
[scl]missing?[np]
[scl]What?[np]
[scl]You want permission
[scl]from the Colonel to
[scl]enter the cave?[np]
[scl]...What on earth?[np]
[scl]...What's in the cave?[np]
[scl]You can't tell me?
[scl]...Okay, just give me
[scl]a minute.
[en1]

Get close and give it
[nl2]a good look.
[en2]

Ah, here's the Colonel's
[nl2]permission slip.[np]
[nl3]Hmmm... Mr. Arnold,
[scl]Entry Allowed.[np]
[scl]Interesting... It
[scl]seems the note says
[scl]I'm not allowed?...[np]
[scl]Are you kids really
[scl]going to be okay on
[scl]your own?[np]
[scl]...I see.
[scl]Well, how's this.
[en1]

How about that?[np]
[nl2]...If you get busted,
[nl3]make a quick get away.[np]
[scl]Make it count.
[en1]

[F2]Received the Colonel's
[nl2]Permission Slip![np]
[nl3]This teacher is...
[scl]He's quite a bit
[scl]mischievous, isn't he??
[en1]

You don't know anything
[nl2]about your teacher's
[nl3]whereabouts?[np]
[scl]...Nothing at all?[np]
[scl]You should tell me
[scl]anything you know!
[en2]

I get the sense you
[nl2]boys have an important
[nl3]task...[np]
[scl]I don't know what it
[scl]could be...
[scl]But give it your all!
[en2]

Mino! Minoo![np]
[nl2]TL: I... HATE... YOU!
[nl3]I'd give my coat to
[scl]anyone else!!
[en2]

...Umm... 
[nl2]It might be broken?
[en2]

Look at the door
[nl2]behind you.[np]
[nl3]That is the only way
[scl]out of here.[np]
[scl]You can't go back now.
[scl]What will you do?[np]
[scl]     -Captain Maverick
[en1]

[X$6A]Good luck you guys!
[nl2]Miss Gina is in your
[nl3]hands now!!
[en1]

...This egress shall
[nl2]remain closed for all
[nl3]of eternity.[np]
[scl]...There shall be no
[scl]escape for you.
[en2]

Take a look around the
[nl2]village.[np]
[nl3]There should be a clue
[scl]leading to the Crystal
[scl]Ball!
[en1]

You should show those
[nl2]documents to some kind
[nl3]of plant expert.[np]
[scl]Uh, me?
[scl]I'm not really an
[scl]expert, you know...[np]
[scl]But...
[scl]...Aren't I a nice guy?
[en1]

You know, withholding
[nl2]documents is very
[nl3]suspicious!
[en1]

To see the village
[nl2]manager, you'll need to
[nl3]call for a meeting.[np]
[scl]If you place that wood
[scl]splinter back into the
[scl]sign,[np]
[scl]you should be able to
[scl]figure out the phone
[scl]number.
[en1]

Hurry and get back to
[nl2]the ship![np]
[nl3]If you want more Luck
[scl]Rocks, look for the
[scl]monkeys on the island.
[scl]Good luck~!
[en1]

If grass is blocking
[nl2]your path, kick it out
[nl3]of the way!
[en1]

I'll let you in on a
[nl2]secret![np]
[nl3]Everything has a weak
[scl]point.[np]
[scl]Just take a closer
[scl]look at the way
[scl]things move.[np]
[scl]I think you'll see what
[scl]I mean!
[en1]

Hurry back to the
[nl2]village![np]
[nl3]Professor Marlowe has
[scl]made a discovery!
[en1]

Why don't you try
[nl2]spraying various
[nl3]things?
[en1]

What's going on?[np]
[nl2]Let's try asking Mr.
[nl3]Smith!
[en1]

Did you try recording
[nl2]a mouse's squeak?[np]
[nl3]If you play it for one
[scl]of the villagers...[np]
[scl]You might find out who
[scl]Mike is that way!
[en1]

The guy you met
[nl2]outside the cave was
[nl3]looking for you!
[en1]

Did you talk to all
[nl2]the villagers?[np]
[nl3]Don't forget to check
[scl]lots of things with
[scl]the [ABtn] button, too~!
[en1]

Instead of eating the
[nl2]meal yourselves...[np]
[nl3]What if you tried to
[scl]give it to someone
[scl]else?[np]
[scl]It seems spicy, so
[scl]they'll probably need
[scl]water afterward.[np]
[scl]Wasn't there some water
[scl]underground by the
[scl]cacti?[np]
[scl]It seemed like it was
[scl]awfully salty though!
[en1]

Wow, stuff is getting
[nl2]out of control![np]
[nl3]After spraying the
[scl]parasite with salt
[scl]water,[np]
[scl]you can try punching
[scl]it with Max.[np]
[scl]If Max doesn't have
[scl]Boxing Gloves, you'll
[scl]need to find some!
[en1]

Oh dear, did you look
[nl2]at the X-Ray?
[nl3]Jack, do something!
[en1]

Did you meet the small
[nl2]people who were
[nl3]attacked by an eagle?[np]
[scl]I suspect they may be
[scl]related to Polly
[scl]somehow!
[en1]

...Giant creatures are
[nl2]attacking the people
[nl3]on this island.[np]
[scl]How did the bugs and
[scl]other animals get so
[scl]be so huge?
[en1]

Boy, what a handful.
[nl2]We have to collect 5
[nl3]objects...[np]
[scl]For now, let's choose
[scl]one of the following
[scl]3 sets of objects:[np] 
[scl]    Frog Tail - Shell
[scl]    Gold Drop - Coat
[scl]    Ag Thread - Paints[X$6E]
[en1]

Frogs don't actually
[nl2]have tails once they've
[nl3]grown...[np]
[scl]But the frog in the
[scl]forest cherishes his.[np]
[scl]If you listen to him
[scl]and follow the power
[scl]cable to the castle,[np]
[scl]you should find a way
[scl]to solve solve his
[scl]problem.[np]
[scl]Then convince him to
[scl]give you his treasure.[np]
[scl]As far as the Forest
[scl]Shell, that's a snail
[scl]shell.[np]
[scl]This is the season
[scl]snails like to change
[scl]their homes.[np]
[scl]Answer the Roly-Poly
[scl]bug's questions
[scl]correctly,[np]
[scl]and then find a house
[scl]a snail might like at
[scl]the shop in the city.
[en1]

The "Golden Drop"
[nl2]refers to honey.[np]
[nl3]There are 3 bees in
[scl]the forest,[np]
[scl]and one of them is
[scl]easily startled.
[scl]You can scare him to
[scl]get a drop,[np]
[scl]but you need to watch
[scl]where it falls and
[scl]remember the location.[np]
[scl]The Forest Coat is a
[scl]bagworm's shell.[np]
[scl]The bagworms in this
[scl]forest are very
[scl]fashionable.
[scl]They will throw away[np]
[scl]their coat if it gets
[scl]dirty.[np]
[scl]You should have an
[scl]item for that, right?
[en1]

There are 4 spiders
[nl2]in the forest who are
[nl3]also brothers.[np]
[scl]The oldest brother is
[scl]able to spin Silver
[scl]Thread.[np]
[scl]However, he goes
[scl]pretty berserk when
[scl]you touch his web,[np]
[scl]so you'll need to watch
[scl]out for his attack.[np]
[scl]You'll need to take a
[scl]preemptive strike at
[scl]him as he charges.[np]
[scl]Once you've used an
[scl]item to stun him
[scl]during his charge,[np]
[scl]you can use another
[scl]item to snag the
[scl]Thread from him.[np]
[scl]You can then retrieve
[scl]3 paint sets from the
[scl]remaining spiders.[np]
[scl]Eh?
[scl]What's the paint for?[np]
[scl]You'd better just
[scl]challenge the spiders
[scl]and get the paints.[np]
[scl]I'm sure it'll come in
[scl]handy later on.[np]
[scl]Just be sure to give
[scl]each of your special
[scl]techniques a try.

You've done a lot, but
[nl2]there's no trace of the

[scl]For the time being,
[scl]perhaps you should go

[en1]

Oh no, it's awful.[np]
[nl2]Polly is being held in
[nl3]the lowest level of

[scl]...Be careful of ants!

Did you help the

[nl3]Search the area near

[scl]Don't you have a tool
[scl]that can dig holes?
[en1]

The little boy in town
[nl2]knows how to defeat a

[scl]Your opening is when

[scl]Think back to earlier

[scl]learned at Caesar's
[scl]house.[np]
[scl]When you do, you'll
[scl]remember the painting
[scl]order.

What are you doing?[np]
[nl2]You've saved Polly's
[nl3]kingdom, but you don't

Hurry up and take the

There's nothing left

[scl]Does it look good?
[scl]    Yup.
[scl]    I hate it.[X$68]
[en1]

What?
[nl2]Then show me something
[nl3]else.
[en2]

Alright!
[nl2]Another successful
[nl3]negotiation...
[en1]

That's weirder than my

[en2]

Could that person
[nl2]be...?[np]
[nl3]No, it couldn't be.
[scl]I'm sorry, forget I
[scl]mentioned it.
[en2]

Our dad is cool, isn't
[nl2]he?

Captain, forgive me!
[en2]

Benson, take care of
[nl2]these children,
[nl3]please!!
[en2]

Ah? Hey bro!
[nl2]Look at my boy!
[en1]

Don't forget that Miss
[nl2]Gina said all 3 of us
[nl3]have to stay together!
[en2]

Come closer and show
[nl2]it to me!
[en2]

...Anyhow, you've
[nl2]disgraced the royal
[nl3]family![np]
[scl]You kids must face
[scl]your punishment.
[en2]

It's a picture of

Let's get close and
[nl2]check it out.
[en2]

This toy robot is
[nl2]enormous...
[en2]

...Whoops!
[nl2]Teamwork takes all 3
[nl3]of us!
[en2]

They look impossible
[nl2]to move...
[en2]

If my dog eats
[nl2]anything, he falls
[nl3]straight to sleep!
[en1]

[nl2]         Not!
[en2]

...Is he alive?
[nl2]Let's get closer and
[nl3]check.
[en2]

...It's a tomato.
[nl2]...That's a relief.
[en2]

Let's get closer and
[nl2]read it.
[en2]

Let's give it a closer
[nl2]look.
[en2]

It's a strangely
[nl2]circular egg.
[en2]

By the way...
[nl2]Do you remember me?
[en2]

Hey, bro!
[en2]

[X$6A][SDenied]
[nl2] You don't have items!
[en2]

Did you open the blue
[nl2]chest?[np]
[nl3]If you use what came
[scl]out of it with [Item], you
[scl]can control the robot!
[en1]

Push the 4 switches
[nl2]inside the cave with
[nl3][TWork]![np]
[scl]Make the strongest boy
[scl]the leader!
[en1]

Open the treasure
[nl2]chest and press the
[nl3]switch on the left.[np]
[scl]You know what I'm
[scl]talking about?
[en1]

You can use the rope
[nl2]with [Item].[np]
[nl3]Use it near the
[scl]pushable boulder!
[en1]

Use the mine cart in
[nl2]the cave to move
[nl3]forward![np]
[scl]Ride the mine cart
[scl]because I sure won't be
[scl]carrying you~!
[en1]

You're an
[nl2]embarrassment, Max.
[en2]

Did you go inside the
[nl2]mansion?[np]
[nl3]In there, you'll find a
[scl]grandfather clock...[np]
[scl]According to Indio's
[scl]memo, set it to 9:30
[scl]and then 10:30.
[en1]

The person who came
[nl2]out of the clock was
[nl3]the man in the photo.[np]
[scl]Which means, that room
[scl]must be a time room![np]
[scl]If you look around in
[scl]there, maybe you can
[scl]find the time machine![np]
[scl]The purple clock looks
[scl]pretty suspicious~.
[en1]

Find the man from the
[nl2]lake and show him the
[nl3]penguin![np]
[scl]He might be happy
[scl]enough to give you a
[scl]gift.
[en1]

Did you listen to
[nl2]Indio?[np]
[nl3]I wonder what he'll say
[scl]if you show him that
[scl]photo.
[en1]

Did you show Benson
[nl2]the picture?[np]
[nl3]I'm sure that will make
[scl]him believe you.
[en1]

Benson knows all about
[nl2]the Mammoth Brothers,[np]
[nl3]so why don't you ask
[scl]him to show you
[scl]around?
[en1]

Check for Benson's
[nl2]smoke signal.[np]
[nl3]Use the telescope in
[scl]the bandit hideout.[np]
[scl]Head wherever the
[scl]his signal is.[np]
[scl]Be sure to use
[scl]teamwork~.
[en1]

Speaking of Luck
[nl2]Rocks, do you have a
[nl3]good stash?[np]
[scl]You'll need a lot to
[scl]defeat the bandits.
[en1]

Check out the Mammoth
[nl2]Brothers with the [ABtn]
[nl3]button~!
[en1]

Benson's final words
[nl2]must be hidden
[nl3]in the village.[np]
[scl]If you follow his
[scl]instructions, you'll
[scl]find the Crystal Ball!
[en1]

Try talking to the man
[nl2]near the gorilla.
[en1]

There's a place to
[nl2]peek into John's
[nl3]house.[np]
[scl]Did you find it?
[scl]Everyone has secrets!
[en1]

Are you stuck in the
[nl2]cave with the mice?[np]
[nl3]Try catching the daddy
[scl]mouse like a fish and
[scl]then tug it gently.
[en1]

The Crystal Ball is in
[nl2]the underground cave!
[nl3]Hurry and get it!
[en1]

Don't forget to give
[nl2]Hassan the items you
[nl3]find in the forest!
[en1]

You should dig here.
[en2]

This is too lame.
[nl2]Only old people like
[nl3]swing!
[en2]

Gramps might be happy
[nl2]to hear this...
[en2]

Find Hassan.
[nl2]He is in the ant
[nl3]colony somewhere.[np]
[scl]Maybe under a boulder.
[en1]

Noses, bird legs, ant
[nl2]legs, spider legs...
[nl3]Maybe they're numbers?
[en2]

Come closer.
[en2]

...Isn't what I should
[nl2]be saying now!
[en2]

It's a "Do Not Enter"
[nl2]sign.
[en2]

[nl2]The guys from earlier?
[en2]

You're the oldest
[nl2]brother!
[en2]

Oh, he caught...
[nl2]something!
[en2]

You're the 2nd
[nl2]brother!
[en2]

It's a suspicious
[nl2]boulder.[np]
[nl3]I think we could lift
[scl]it if we work
[scl]together...
[en2]

It's the monkey from
[nl2]before.

Luck Rocks won't come
[nl2]out anymore.

You're the youngest!

Ooo, kii, kii, kii![np]

Huh? The footprints

[nl3]I wonder why?

What is this?
[nl2]There are 4 handles.
[en2]

What's with this grass?
[nl2]It's dried out like a
[nl3]mummy.
[en2]

What a weird robot.
[nl2]It's sprinkling water
[nl3]like it's haywire.
[en2]

Something's written on
[nl2]the ground...
[en2]

[nl2]Grr. Bark bark. Growl.
[en2]

You can't see what is
[nl2]written.
[en2]

Hey!
[nl2]It's the Crystal Ball!
[en2]

It's a pipe.
[en2]

Water is pouring out.
[en2]

Now boys, try not to
[nl2]do anything too
[nl3]dangerous, alright?[np]
[scl]You don't have to say
[scl]anything.[np]
[scl]I can see it in your
[scl]eyes...
[en2]

Ah... So that means...
[nl2]You were worried about
[nl3]me,[np]
[scl]and now you've become a
[scl]ghost to come check on
[scl]me?!

It's a strange rock

Thank you for
[nl2]collecting the
[nl3]firewood, [team] Team.
[en2]

This pipe sure is in

[en2]

What's this mark?

The plant that

[nl3]huge...!
[en2]

[nl2] Huh? There's a hole.
[en2]

[nl2]     It's a sign!
[en2]

A treasure chest!!
[en2]

I heard from Dorothy
[nl2]that you collected the
[nl3]firewood!
[en2]

The parasite has been
[nl2]cleansed from the

Too bad.

Pshaw...[np]
[nl2]Someone told you I

[en2]

Who are you kids...?!
[en2]

Grr~! Bark bark ruff!!
[en2]

Why is a plant growing

[en2]

A dog's corpse came
[nl2]out...[np]
[nl3][SImprtnt]The collar is the same

There might be a prize

[nl3]forgive me?

All these kids keep
[nl2]coming in here for the
[nl3]free bonus toy.[np]
[scl]Every caramel comes
[scl]with a "Great Mecha"
[scl]toy.[np]
[scl]Apparently,"Great
[scl]Mecha" is popular with
[scl]the kids nowadays.
[en2]

Go, Great Mecha #3!!
[nl2]Giga-giga-gigachaaan~!
[nl3]Buh-BOOM!
[en2]

Like my Great Mecha
[nl2]#3?[np]
[nl3]It moves all on its
[scl]own.
[scl]Pretty cool, right?[np]
[scl]But it's mine, so don't
[scl]get all touchy now, ya
[scl]hear?
[en2]

Next is [team] Team!
[nl2]First, we have the
[nl3]ever-energetic, Deon!
[en1]

Now, I'll pick the
[nl2]team leader.[np]
[nl3]Hmmm, is it okay if I
[scl]make Deon the leader
[scl]for now?[np]
[scl]Okay then, as the
[scl]leader, you get to
[scl]wear this!
[en1]

Ooh, looking sharp.[np]
[nl2]You can change the
[nl3]leader with [RBtn].[np]
[scl]So, decide amongst
[scl]yourselves who should
[scl]lead.
[en1]

The most important
[nl2]thing about camping is
[nl3]teamwork.[np]
[scl]Don't forget that all
[scl]3 of you need to work
[scl]together.[np]
[scl]Press the [YBtn] button
[scl]to blow your whistle
[scl]and gather up.
[en2]

Hot dang that is a
[nl2]dorky hat. Haha.[np]
[nl3]Did you suck up to the
[scl]teacher for it?[np]
[scl]Camping is so stupid I
[scl]can't stand it. Ugh![np]
[scl]Why do I have to be in
[scl]charge of fishing?[np]
[scl]That teach' makes me
[scl]so mad!
[en2]

Well if it isn't [team]
[nl2]Team.
[nl3]Wanna know a secret?[np]
[scl]Come closer and I'll
[scl]tell you.
[en2]

Hey, [team] Team, do
[nl2]something about Jim,
[nl3]won't you?
[en2]

Oh? You think you can
[nl2]take me?![np]
[nl3]Haha, give it your
[scl]best shot.
[en2]

Hey hey!
[nl2]Hurry up and kick it.
[nl3]We're not done yet.
[en2]

It's a switch that you
[nl2]press from above.
[en2]

It worked![np]
[nl2]...We knew you'd come
[nl3]for that woman no
[scl]matter what.
[en2]

Is everyone okay?...
[nl2]Good.
[nl3]Me?... I'm fine.
[en2]

N...Nice work.[np]
[nl2]You're the first to
[nl3]ever beat my iron
[scl]guard.[np]
[scl]What? You want a
[scl]"prize"? [np]
[scl]...Those idiots and
[scl]their promises... [np]
[scl]Fine, a man doesn't go
[scl]back on his word.[np]
[scl]...This is all I have,
[scl]but alright.[np]
[scl]I'll give it to... That
[scl]lanky fiend, Jack.
[scl]Take it.
[en2]

Good one! Cool, huh?
[nl2]Jim wasn't mad that I
[nl3]made the promise?
[en2]

Hehehe... Feelin' good!
[en2]

Ah, crap~.
[nl2]What should I do...?
[en2]

Go [team] Team go![np]
[nl2]For the beauty of your
[nl3]teacher[~]! Fight,
[scl]fight, [team] Team!
[en2]

This boulder...
[nl2]Looks sorta like a
[nl3]skull.[np]
[scl]It's a bit suspicious
[scl]looking.
[en2]

It looks like this box
[nl2]is blocking the exit.[np]
[nl3]I don't really know
[scl]what's up, but I feel
[scl]bad for the monkeys.
[en2]

[X$6A]...H, Hello?
[nl2]Nuts, no answer.
[en2]

This door looks
[nl2]awfully rusty...
[nl3]It seems quite old.
[en2]

I'll take revenge for
[nl2]my friend!
[nl3]En garde!
[en2]

[X$6A]Oh, the shame![np]
[nl2]It's so frustrating to
[nl3]lose to the enemy in
[scl]a place like this.
[en2]

This is where the
[nl2]soldier was.[np]
[nl3]Hm?
[scl]Something seems odd.
[en2]

What could it be?
[en2]

There's some kind of
[nl2]hole in the ground
[nl3]here...?
[en2]

A rusty robot!?
[nl2]...Does it still work?
[en2]

Hey, give it a try.[np]
[nl2]Maybe... We can't leave
[nl3]until the blue box is
[scl]opened.
[en2]

What's the matter?
[nl2]I wonder if we're lost?
[en2]

...Crap! You knew?
[nl2]Fine, a promise is a
[nl3]promise. Wait here.
[en1]

[team] Team, I heard
[nl2]you're collecting the 
[nl3]firewood.
[en2]

Hey! [team] Team!
[nl2]Great timing.[np]
[nl3]We were putting water
[scl]in this pot...[np]
[scl]But we put in too much
[scl]and now we can't move
[scl]it~!
[en2]

[nl2]     Let's use [TWork]!
[en2]

...What's this?
[en2]

There's a trick to
[nl2]catching fish.
[nl3]Want me to tell you?
[en2]

[nl2]   Hey! [team] Team!
[nl3]            [np]
[scl]It was getting late,
[scl]so I came looking for
[scl]you.[np]
[scl]What are you boys
[scl]doing way out here?[np]
[scl]You'll give me a heart
[scl]attack, you know.
[en1]

What are you doing?
[nl2]You still have a
[nl3]chance.
[en2]

[nl2]What's this?
[en2]

Bad news! Miss Gina
[nl2]was kidnapped by
[nl3]pirates!
[en2]

Hffeeggghhh! Mnnffgh!
[nl2]Ffnngggrrrfph-!
[en2]

What's wrong with you?
[nl2]Hurry up and take off
[nl3]these chains!
[en2]

What's wrong?
[nl2]You still have 1
[nl3]chance left.
[en2]

What could this be?
[en2]

It changes direction
[nl2]if you don't hold it
[nl3]steady...What a pain!!
[en2]

Huh?!
[nl2]Something's not right!
[en2]

How careless.
[nl2]Let's nab the rest!
[en1]

How careless.
[nl2]Let's take them to our
[nl3]boss!
[en1]

I'm the greatest
[nl2]pirate under the sky,
[nl3]King Blue![np]
[scl]I'm so spectacular,[np]
[scl]crying children stop
[scl]crying and stare in
[scl]awe when they see me.[np]
[scl]You kids too terrified
[scl]to talk?[np]
[scl]If you don't give me
[scl]what I want,[np]
[scl]your pretty little
[scl]teacher will die.[np]
[scl]Don't try to play dumb
[scl]with me either, I know
[scl]you guys took it!
[en1]

Kids, lemme tell you
[nl2]one thing: stay away
[nl3]from that mansion.
[en2]

What do you want?
[nl2]I'm busy now, so could
[nl3]you leave me alone?
[en2]

Only one Crystal Ball
[nl2]isn't enough...
[nl3]Or so it seems...
[en2]

What in the world is
[nl2]going on?
[en2]

[SP$011A]Now's our chance!
[nl2]Get 'em!
[en1]

It's a mechanical
[nl2]door...[np]
[nl3]It's awfully old, but
[scl]it seems to still be
[scl]functional.
[en2]

Hey! The Patchies!!
[en2]

...I must be a little
[nl2]too heavy.[np]
[nl3]You kids go on ahead.
[scl]Don't worry about me.
[scl]  ...I'll be okay...
[en2]

Tomatoes are full of
[nl2]nutrients and good for
[nl3]your body!
[en2]

Phooey!
[nl2]Don't think we'll just
[nl3]let you slide on by!!
[en1]

Don't even think about
[nl2]it!
[en1]

A strange door!
[en2]

Wow~!
[nl2]This is pretty sturdy!
[en2]

It's a huge log!
[en2]

Huh?
[nl2]What does this say...
[en2]

What happened?
[nl2]Your teacher came
[nl3]rushing out.
[en2]

[X$6A]The... The picture
[nl2]talked!
[nl3]It's a ghost!!
[en2]

Hmph, don't get weird
[nl2]ideas in your head.[np]
[nl3]I wouldn't want to team[np]
[scl]up with scum like you
[scl]in 100 years.
[en2]

You want me to go with
[nl2]you?
[nl3]Don't be stupid![np]
[scl]A captain goes down
[scl]with his ship.
[en2]

The wall here seems
[nl2]new.
[en2]

[nl2]Shh! Be silent!
[en2]

[nl2]It's an old journal.
[en2]

[nl2]Hey~, is that funny?
[en2]

Very big clocks~.
[nl2]Grandfather clocks~.
[nl3]Now.. They're... Gone!
[en2]

[nl2]  I've been waiting!
[en2]

There are stairs up
[nl2]here...
[en2]

I'm so excited.
[nl2]My heart is pounding.
[en2]

Haha, I got you good!
[nl2]These pop when they're
[nl3]hit from above.[np]
[scl]They don't hurt, so
[scl]don't worry.
[en2]

This is my friend, a
[nl2]migratory bird.[np]
[nl3]He was just coming to
[scl]visit me.[np]
[scl]Hey, say hello.
[en1]

Something was under
[nl2]the grave stone.
[en1]

[F2]Received a Mysterious,
[nl2]Old Photograph!
[en1]

This sure is an old
[nl2]photo...[np]
[nl3]Who could these people
[scl]be...?[np]
[scl]And what's that guy
[scl]holding?
[scl]Could it be...![np]
[scl]The people in town
[scl]might know more.
[scl]
[en2]

This was a lively town
[nl2]until the bandits
[nl3]attacked.[np]
[scl]Now our crops won't
[scl]even grow!
[en2]

The grave off on its
[nl2]own is where Indio,[np]
[nl3]the leader of the
[scl]mountain bandits,
[scl]rests.[np]
[scl]He was arrested right
[scl]away,[np]
[scl]but we never found the
[scl]"Town's Treasure"...
[en2]

Hrrrmm... That woman's
[nl2]child was kidnapped by 
[nl3]Indio's daughter,[np] 
[scl]or so it rightly
[scl]seems...[np]
[scl]The girl lives out
[scl]East of Death Lake
[scl]o'er yonder...[np]
[scl]But e'en just the name
[scl]gives me the tootin'
[scl]willies,[np]
[scl]so I'm a'ferd I  won't
[scl]be goin' any time
[scl]soon...[np]
[scl]Will ya go in my
[scl]stead?[np]
[scl]I rightly doubt Indio's
[scl]daughter means the
[scl]child ny' harm,[np]
[scl]but just ta' be
[scl]on the safe side...[np]
[scl]Tha entrance ta' Death
[scl]Lake is guarded by ma'
[scl]dog,[np]
[scl]but don't ya' worry.[np]
[scl]Just toss im' a bone
[scl]and he'll fall right
[scl]asleep. ...Voila!
[en1]

I'm the sheriff 'round
[nl2]these parts.[np]
[nl3]That woman o'er thar
[scl]seems to be in a heap
[scl]o'trouble.
[en2]

Did you find the
[nl2]little chickabiddy?[np]
[nl3]He's with Indio's
[scl]kin on the other
[scl]side of "Death Lake."
[en2]

What?! You lost the
[nl2]fixin's? Well fine~.
[nl3]...Take this.
[en1]

Please, save my child![np]
[nl2]He would never wander
[nl3]into "Death Lake" on
[scl]his own.[np]
[scl]I'm sure Indio's
[scl]daughter must have
[scl]kidnapped him![np]
[scl]Her father was the
[scl]leader of the bandits,
[scl]after all.
[en2]

Hello my little
[nl2]travelers, how are you
[nl3]feeling today?[np]
[scl]This town used to be
[scl]a pirate port.
[en2]

That old thing?
[en2]

It's an air balloon!
[nl2]There's a basket at
[nl3]the bottom.
[en2]

Did you boys get rid
[nl2]of the mutant flowers?
[nl3]Wow![np]
[scl]This boy was trying to
[scl]find me and got lost
[scl]in Death Lake...[np]
[scl]I found him and
[scl]brought him back here,
[scl]but we were trapped.[np]
[scl]Thanks to you, now he
[scl]can go home safely.
[en2]

People in town always
[nl2]bad mouth Miss Sisko,[np]
[nl3]but she's not a bad
[scl]person![np]
[scl]She teaches me lots of
[scl]stuff!
[en2]

Don't mind what he
[nl2]said.[np]
[nl3]The people of this
[scl]town think my father
[scl]stole their treasure.[np]
[scl]But, I've long believed
[scl]my father to be
[scl]innocent of the crime.[np]
[scl]Still, no one will
[scl]even visit his
[scl]grave...[np]
[scl]Only his pet crow
[scl]keeps him company.[np]
[scl]
[scl]          ...I have a
[scl]favor to ask you boys.[np]
[scl]Could you please take
[scl]these flowers to his
[scl]grave?
[en1]

He didn't mean anything
[nl2]by it.
[en2]

Did you take flowers
[nl2]to my father's grave?[np]
[nl3]I'm sure the crow will
[scl]remember me if you
[scl]show him the flowers.
[en2]

Thank you! Thank you![np]
[nl2]It was Miss Sisko,
[nl3]wasn't it?[np]
[scl]The apple doesn't fall
[scl]far from the tree,
[scl]does it?
[en2]

Please, guys![np]
[nl2]Tell everyone that
[nl3]Miss Sisko isn't a bad
[scl]person!
[en2]

Thanks, pardners![np]
[nl2]If anything else goes
[nl3]awry, be sure to come
[scl]on back y'hear!
[en2]

[SMonkey2]Caw caw![np]
[nl2]TL: No one is getting
[nl3]near this grave!
[en2]

It says: The hero who
[nl2]protected our town,[np]
[nl3]Christopher Benson,
[scl]rests here.
[en2]

"Grave of the Super-
[nl2]Evil Bandit, Indio."
[nl3]...Is written here.[np]
[scl]...What...?
[en2]

Something came out of
[nl2]the grave.[np]
[nl3]It looks like a
[scl]picture...
[en2]

This is a mysterious
[nl2]house without an
[nl3]entrance.[np]
[scl]Speaking of
[scl]mysterious houses,[np]
[scl]it is said that in the
[scl]middle of the night,[np]
[scl]you can hear clocks
[scl]ringing in the mansion
[scl]East of here.[np]
[scl]Creepy stuff, right?
[en2]

Things were so much
[nl2]better back in the
[nl3]day...[np]
[scl]We were pirates and
[scl]the grass was green.[np]
[scl]Then the bandits took
[scl]our "Treasure" and it
[scl]all went to hell...
[en2]

This is the only water
[nl2]in town.[np]
[nl3]I should've listened to
[scl]Indio and dug more
[scl]wells...
[en2]

A long time ago I
[nl2]thought about making a
[nl3]digging machine,[np]
[scl]but I lost the
[scl]blueprints...[np]
[scl]So those parts are now
[scl]just a pile of junk![np]
[scl]Take it if you want
[scl]it.
[en2]

This dog is in the
[nl2]way...
[en2]

The dog fell fast
[nl2]asleep after eating![np]
[nl3]I don't think he'll be
[scl]up any time soon...
[en2]

It's a dog food dish.
[en2]

[F2]Received Flowers from

[en2]

There's a picture
[nl2]here.
[en2]

Trouble? You boys want
[nl2]to see inside the
[nl3]mansion next door?
[en2]

A long time ago, in
[nl2]the mansion next door,[np]
[nl3]Indio and my husband
[scl]had some project they
[scl]were working on.
[en2]

We're the pirate
[nl2]Patchie Brothers![np]
[nl3]You're pretty pathetic 
[scl]to have fallen into
[scl]our trap.[np]
[scl]Want out?[np]
[scl]Then you've gotta guess
[scl]our age relationship
[scl]in order![np]
[scl]Ya hear?[np]
[scl]I'll explain...
[en2]

I told you guys to
[nl2]stay out of here![np]
[nl3]I gave you your honey,
[scl]didn't I?
[en2]

It'll take a lot of
[nl2]firewood to heat up
[nl3]this giant pot.
[en2]

It's sort of sad to
[nl2]see our hard work go
[nl3]up in flames...
[en2]

The fire went out.
[nl2]I don't think the
[nl3]cooking finished.

Please listen to me!
[nl2]Everyone in town says
[nl3]they've seen a ghost,[np]

I heard that house

[nl3]Now, all the

[scl]What is going on
[scl]here~?!
[en2]

It seems a ghost has
[nl2]appeared![np]
[nl3]It must be someone's
[scl]idea of a joke.

They say there's a
[nl2]ghost in town!

It's someone's shadow...
[nl2]Who's there?!

I'm not a ghost or a

My daddy isn't here

That's a bird egg my

It hatched! A baby

This mutant flower has
[nl2]very strong petals!
[nl3]It's almost like it's
[scl]protecting something
[scl]inside...

This part seems to be
[nl2]the root.[np]
[nl3]I wonder which flower
[scl]is connected to it?

The petals were
[nl2]protecting this part![np]
[nl3]Isn't there some way

Oh man...

Was Indio really

[nl3]the "town's treasure"?[np]
[scl]What's the Sheriff got

[en2]

Hey, that's a penguin![np]
[nl2]If you dig where he

According to my gut,

What are you doing?[np]
[nl2]Did you forget how to
[nl3]start the ship's

I'm sure the entrance

[nl3]Those Mammoth jerks
[scl]must have sealed it

It'll just take one

Granny's bed, maybe?

It's covered with
